    I removed your submission. Looks like you're asking for help with
    your homework. Try posting to /r/learnmachinelearning or a related

    Thanks.
- title: /r/datascience is not a crowd-sourced Google
  message: >
    I removed your submission. Looks like you're asking a basic question
    with a widely agreed upon answer. Try using a search engine instead.

    "Search engine questions" hurt the subreddit because they don't generate
    enough discussion and lower the overall quality of the forum.

    Thanks.

  message: >
    I removed your submission. We prefer to minimize the amount of
    promotional material in the subreddit, whether it is a company
    selling a product/services or a user trying to sell themselves.

    Thanks.

  message: >
    I removed your submission.  This subreddit is not for finding or
    sharing datasets. Please post in r/datasets or a subreddit specific
    to your area of interest.

    Thanks.
