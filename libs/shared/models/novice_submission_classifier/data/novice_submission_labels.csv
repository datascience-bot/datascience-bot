&#x200B;

Approach:

1. I will start off by posting top level comments as generic skill sets that are either business, technical, statistics and mathematics related.
2. Upvote the ones you believe are important core skill sets, but DO NOT downvote any other skills if you disagree/don't know is key. If you don't agree with a skill set not being core, simply don't upvote.
3. Leave your comments as second level comments so the top comments are always relating to the skills in question.
4. Add skills you think are important but you don't find them in top level comments.
5. By the end of the whole exercise, with enough votes, I believe we should then be able to see our crowdsourced key skills for this profession that are sought after and are important to being a good data scientist/analyst (note: my methodology may have loopholes, so please feel free to suggest some changes, I have a research methodology and statistics background but don't profess to be an expert, so comments welcomed)

avxufp,False,Python just isn't worth the hassle,"I'm an experienced data scientist (I actually lead a large team) and am reasonably literate about computers, though I am not a developer or IT professional. My organization is split roughly 50/50 between Python users and R users (and a few unicorns who are proficient in both). The general consensus, with which I don't disagree, is that R is generally better for data analysis/exploration/visualization because of dplyr and 
ggplot2 (tidyverse), and Python is generally better for machine learning because of sklearn, Keras, and Tensorflow. And yet, R is good enough for machine learning (mlr, caret) and Python good enough for data analysis/exploration/visualization (pandas, matplotlib) that you don't \*really\* need to learn the other unless you stumble upon some problem for which there is no library in your preferred language.

I started out using R when I got into data science because the guy who was showing me the ropes was an R guy. I was able to quickly and easily get RStudio installed on my machine, load up the packages I need, and start learning the language. R has plenty of quirks, but it has served me well over the years and I am able to do pretty much anything I need to do with it short of really complicated deep learning, which isn't really a requirement at the company I'm at anyway. For nearly all of our ML problems, some combination of linear regression, random forests, or XGBoost will get the job done. And mxnet actually works pretty well for deep learning in R.

However, I always want to expand my skillset, and I have tried several times to work in Python. The first time, a friend showed me how to set up a Jupyter Notebook and I was able to get some basic things working in that after several hours of trying to set it up. The biggest pain was realizing that I had to install Python on a path without any spaces in it and then go set my Windows path variable to get it to work. I eventually decided that R tools suited me better and went back to R. I tried again a year later when I wanted to play around with deep learning and was able to get TensorFlow working after **several** **days** of wading through their never-correct documentation, scraping message boards for help, and eventually finding a blog post that solved the rest of my problem. Then I decided that the syntax was way more complicated than it needed to be (I wasn't aware of Keras yet), and went back to using mxnet in R.

The other day, I discovered the reticulate package for R and have been trying to get it to work, with no success. I have read through all the documentation, tried using conda\_install() and use\_python() to create a virtual environment with all the libraries I need, but it is failing to find numpy. On the reticulate page, my exact situation exists as an open issue and there has been a long chain of discussion but no resolution. Several hours down the drain.

My point is, RStudio installed just fine on the first try. All the packages load and work pretty much right away. I've never had to worry about keeping several version of R on my machine or changing any environment variables. I haven't had to spend endless hours digging through message boards just to get R to *run*. I really want to learn to like Python, but it *really makes itself hard to love*. I'm too busy to spend days and days setting it up and tweaking things. Why hasn't one of the most popular programming languages in the world been able to get some *basic* things right such as, ""You can run this installer on Windows 10 and it will work out of the box""?",superduck12,3496,3245,1486067335.0,1587265998.923008

I work as a lead project manager for a very large company. I am good at my job (or at least my yearly performance reviews say that) but I honestly don't like my job. I am regularly given failing projects and tasked with replanning the project. The stress is wearing me out. I want to work in data science - I'll have my MSc in data analytics within the year and I'm working on creating a portfolio and getting my first data science job. I incorporate data science techniques into what I do and I credit that with what makes me successful.


Situation: 
My company is very antiquated and slow to adopt new technologies. At the end of last year they announced they were going to start embedding data analysts within teams and hire some data scientists. I thought great, here's my chance to get into the field. 


I cannot get an interview to be a data analyst because, according to the hiring manager, I don't have experience. It's frustrating because I regularly demonstrate the application of the needed skills and knowledge, but okay fine.


Fast forward a few weeks a newly hired data analyst is imbeded with my team. I try to make the best of it and think, hey, I can talk data science with this guy.


The person hired doesn't have a background in data science. He doesn't know statistics or any programming languages. He had to ask me for help writing a simple SQL query so he could put the data into Excel and make a pivot chart. The hiring managers are business people who don't know anything about data science. The data analysts are being used as Excel jockies.


I don't fault the people hired as data analysts but it frustrates me that the managers have no idea what they are doing in regards to hiring and utilizing data analysts. I feel like within my company they are devaluing data science by having people not in the field doing the hiring and management of the analysts. It's looking more and more like I'll have to leave the company to work in my desired field. That will be difficult because I'll likely have to take a pay cut to get a job elsewhere.

azmeem,True,Best self-study path as a math + computer science undergrad?,"Hello guys,  


I am here because I need some advice on what path to take for my studies. I feel like the options are so wide and I am a bit overwhelmed. I'll introduce myself first so you can have the ""big picture"":

# Introduction

There is a tldr for this part right after it.

I am a 21 years old male from Quebec. I was always really good with maths and have a great intuition with everything math-related (well up until Analysis 3 and CLOSED BALL IS NOT COMPACT IN C\[0,1\] WUT?) .  4 years ago I entered my university in Mathematics (actuarial sc. specialization). I figured after taking Economics and Fin. that it wasn't for me, and I really liked discrete maths and analysis so I switched for pure maths.  
I stayed in pure maths for 3 semesters and I really liked it, but I realized that it's more like a hobby than a career path for me (I really don't see myself doing research). This is where I first started gaining an interest in programming. I did not know about data science yet. I decided to change to Math + Computer Science in march, near the end of the winter semester. It was a good move since like 90% of my credits were still good.

I then spent the summer learning C++ as I didn't know in what area of C.S I would end up and I like a challenge (plus I felt like it would help me understands the core of programming more than if I would have started with say Python). Eventually I heard about data science during the semester and I knew it was made for me (I LOVE problem solving, I am good with intuition, finding the optimal way to do things, maths, etc).   
Fast forward to today and here I am: A math and computer science undergrad (but with like 3 math credits left and almost all of them in CS to do). I am pretty good with C++ (I understand well the core of the language, so I can do pretty much every intermediate-level console app assignments that I can find in books easily). I got my first programming class two semesters ago in JavaScript and I aced it since I saw everything by myself in C++ (I must say I hate JS, so web development got out of the question pretty quick). I am now doing Programming 2 in Java and it's the same story.

   I picked up ""Data Structures and Algorithms in C++"" by Adam Drozdek and am currently in Chapter 3. I have an overview knowledge of every main data structure and I am trying to understand it in depth with this book. It's good that it's old, because since took a modern C++ class (well free online course I mean), I can try to reimplement the examples in the book but in modern C++. I already passed the Complexity Theory chapter (it was really brieve though) and I understand it well since it's basic maths. I have a good understanding of basic Probabilities and statistics (Let's say I do well with the 10 first chapters of ""Introduction to Probability and Statistics"" by Mendenhall)

## TLDR
* Third year Math + Computer Science undergrad
* Strong pure math background (Analysis 3, differential geometry, Algebra, linear algebra, etc...)
* Core understanding of Probabilities and Stats (10 first chapters of ""Introduction to Probability and Statistics"" by Mendenhall) AND stochastics process (Markov, semi-Markov, Poisson's, etc)
* Good with problem solving
* Good with core C++ and a good part of STL
* Can code basic stuff with JavaScript, Java and Python
* Good with basic git (up to pull requests / branching)

# What next?

The reason I am here today is because I don't know where to go from there. I am really motivated, but the options I have are really wide. I am really curious about machine learning and I think I will orient myself towards it, but I'm open to other paths too.

* I could continue with my ""Data Structures and Algorithms in C++"" book (which I will probably do since it's pretty important imo
* I could start learning Python and it's libraries
* I could start learning R and it's libraries
* I could start learning machine learning (the theory)
* I could continue with C++ (Qt, SFML, other?) to understand programming more in-depth
* I could learn SQL
* I could strenghten my Probability and Statistics knowledge (Numerical Analysis? Linear Regression? Tests?)

This is my ideas right now but of course it's what *I* see, and I would like to hear YOUR opinions. I found [this image](https://i.ibb.co/C53pvQJ/Data-Science-parcours.jpg) but I'm not sure it's completely accurate and it still has many options. 
What should I do? What should I NOT do? I want to hear your opinions! (I am not looking for books or resources because I read the FAQ and there is already so much informations in there, but more for a WHAT to do answer)

Thank you very much for reading, I know when I start I can write long texts and I'm sorry for this. I hope I hear from some of you!

b08fzi,False,Politics and Psychology of Data Science's 'Last Mile',"Dear fellow DS-Redditors,

in our company, my Data Science team is currently struggling with the 'last mile', i.e. have our insights and predictions bring about actual change.

We have sufficiently mastered the technical aspects, with APIs and platform at our disposal and available to others. Also, we've established trust with senior management executives.

What remains is to convince coworkers from other departments, e.g. sales, to work with us. Many hesitate to cooperate or to make use of our results and our work, and I feel like this boils down to a couple of human reasons:

* The generally resist change, especially when initiated by others
* Their division manager might have a long-standing rivalry with our division manager
* They see us and our suggestions/results as 'invading their territory'
* They view us as young and snobbish know-it-alls

How would you approach this problem? 

As a last measure, we could make our case with the executive level and have them pressure their guys to cooperate. However, we'd really like to solve this problem 'bottom-up' instead of 'top-down'.

Cheers and thank you!
Derek

b2y44s,False,How can I help my company prepare for my departure as a data analyst?,"(Sorry for such a long post; main question is at very end.)

I have finally received an acceptance letter for a Statistics grad program (yay!), and plan on leaving my company in late summer to go back to school full time.  I currently work as a data analyst for an automotive supplier, and my boss is aware that I will be leaving the company, and he will be working with HR soon to start the process of finding (and potentially using me in part to train) a replacement.  Thankfully, everyone is very supportive.

I was the first person in the company, so far as I am aware of, who does ""data analysis"" and has a statistical background, novice as I am on paper in that matter.  I am not very happy with the way my job is currently structured and would have planned on leaving anyway if I had not gotten an acceptance.  My work is not very well defined; there are data management issues (like storage, access, standardization across sites) which slow work; and I do not have anyone in my company who is able to double check my work from a statistical POV—or even more preferably, elevate it to (and appreciate) a higher sophistication.  While officially on a team, I am not on a team of people who do what I do, and am very independent anyway.

I have been asked to help craft a job description for my replacement.  However, while I can easily regurgitate my current responsibilities onto paper and list what skills I have found useful for executing them, I would like to expand this task to communicate back to my employer how best to structure such a job, from hierarchy of needs they should be considering in order to streamline the data analysis process (instead of merely filling roles I have been haphazardly shoehorned into, and ignoring needs which subsume them), to better establishing specific duties to achieve those ends (instead of giving the next person as much autonomy as I have).

I would like to do this, and have come to this community for feedback on how to do so, for two main reasons: (1) I myself need to grow and manage my expectations for what a better data analysis or data science job looks like, and (2) I would like my successor(s) to experience that better if I have some latitude to reform it.

To give a rough outline for what I would like to learn and communicate back to my company, posed as questions:

- **What are the standard vertical and horizontal structures surrounding a technical job like an analyst?**  Right now, I receive work not only directly from my boss, but also often directly from different people in the company (some high up) who are aware of me and the statistical skills I provide.  Sometimes these projects do not have established timelines or well-defined metrics or goals, and this creates disorganization and workload/expectation problems.  After working like this for some time, it seems to me that a wiser system would be for projects to be administered through management, and interactions between groups (such as, a chemical test lab group and my group (myself)) to ultimately start and end from above.  Is this misguided?  How do project management and team interactions work in well-functioning systems?

- With deference to some of the prior considerations, **what sort of environment (have you found) works best for a data analyst to thrive in?**  For instance, I feel that I would have liked to have another person on my team who does what I do so I could bounce ideas off them and assert my own expectations better.  I also feel that the rest of the company isn't very good at managing their own expectations for what a single data analyst can do, and my position as an almost independent service provider within the company speaks to that.  How are data analysis teams organized and how do they manage the request-result cycle?

- **What functions often go underserved in a company starting to sophisticate its data analysis process, and what skills should it seek out to fill those?**  As I mentioned above, there are non-homogeneities in how data is collected and stored and made accessible between different manufacturing or test sites that we have, and some projects that they would want to work on in the foreseeable future will involve more sharing of this data between sites.  Data is often dumped into a ""vault"" specific to each site (with very limited read access), and can be made available in a hodge-podge way on a network we have.  It doesn't seem conducive to accessibility.  I am also woefully underinformed on the full extent of data management at our company, so the problem may just be my level of knowledge; but the prescription nonetheless may be bringing in someone with the skills required to interact with the data we have, even if vaulting and networks are enough.  Who works behind the scenes that a data analyst depends on?  What skills should that person have?

- Finally, **How can I combine the above into job description(s), for employer and prospective employee alike?**  How many people make a good team?  What should they each bring to the table?

These are the things about which I will likely ask more follow up questions.  That may come when I have done some more thorough investigation into what expectations and gaps people in my company find for data analysis.  I also may not be asking the right questions, and I may have different ones depending on the feedback I get here.

Right now though, I think this is my question for this post:

How would you characterize a ""good"" and functional data analyst role and what does their team look like?",richard_sympson,129,17796,1401216534.0,1587265998.923008
b2zuev,False,Why is Python pushed so much?,"Hey guys.

I want to discuss about something that is itching me right now.

I recently posted in the weekly Entering thread. I am a student in mathematics and computer science who is studying to become a data scientist. I am currently learning C++ by myself and was told to transition to Python ASAP. I was reading a Data Structures and Algorithms book (in C++) during that time (and still am, spoiler!)

So I did my DD and told myself why not learn that subject in Python to learn the language at the same time? There's where it became more problematic. I understand fully that for someone who wants to become a data scientist, Python is mandatory since it has these beautiful libraries for machine learning & co. But the problem I faced is that when I wanted to implement my own data structures in Python, I realized that so much is done under the hood that it's pretty much impossible to get an in-depth understanding on what is happening, and to optimize stuff on ""my way"".

So my question goes as follow : Since optimizing is a huge part in a data scientist job, and playing with data structures/optimizing algorithms is also so important, why is it not pushed more to get a core undestanding of it? I understand you can use stuff that you don't understand completely, but for someone who's JOB is to use it, shouldn't he understand at least the fundamentals?

I want to hear your opinions!

PS: Just to be sure, I am not ranting on Python, I am saying it's hader to get a grasp on the core because it's all done out of sight. I am not saying C++ is better either, I am asking why people do not recommend to learn a lower level language (any!) before learning Python.

Thank you guys.

You've heard heaps of stories of people from all over the world trying to enter the field because it's hyping right now. I am one of them (very selling).

I moved to marketing data analysis field almost accidentally, as I needed it to work on the analysis to get Permanent Residence in another country. However, I got really into it!

b41egp,False,How to get an internship in 2019,"So you want a coveted internship? This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.

I have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.

Whether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.

If you prefer video format, here’s a video I made covering these topics:

[https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng](https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng)

The first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.

The second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \[Insert college here\], and then use people filters such as 1st /2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.

The best people in your network to reach out to are:

\- College / coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at

\- Friends / classmates who interned at that company

\- Professors / mentors who might have connections with that company

\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - “friends of friends who worked at \[X company\]

The next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don’t send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples’ work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you’ll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:

\~\~\~

Hi \[person’s name\]!

My name is \[your name\], and I’m an \[type of engineer\] in \[location\].

I’m reaching out because I applied to \[company\] regarding your \[position\].

I have experience with \[this technology, skill, etc\]

Following up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.

Would someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \[insert date to add time pressure\]?

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\[Phone number\]

\~\~\~

Following up after they’ve responded:

Would you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\~\~\~

The most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don’t respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.

If you’ve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them “How can I stand out in the intern application process for \[X\] company?”, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you’d be a good fit.

Another way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn’t absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:

\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)

\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section

\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)

\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them

The next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you’ve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won’t make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you’ve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you’re ready to go because you know you prepared!

The final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There’s a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!

I customized the funnel by tracking:

1. Company Name
2. Position Name
3. Contact Name
4. Contact Email
5. Contact LinkedIn
6. Date of Last Contact
7. Job Source
8. Job Posting URL

If you’re not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!

The job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That’s what will ultimately start you on your journey.",mattupham,2067,540,1507009802.0,1587265998.923008

So, like a lot of people on this page, I'm interested in transitioning to a career in data science. I graduated with degrees in biology and comp sci. in 2017, and have been working jobs in biological research since then. Long story short, I used to think I wanted to go to grad school for bio - but not so much anymore. I'm thinking about transitioning into data science, and was looking for some advice on the best way to do so. I have a few options:

1. Leave this job in the upcoming months, learn/build as much as I can in the meantime, and then apply for jobs in the Fall.
2. Stay at this job for a while, where I have the potential to complete a master's very inexpensively (like maybe 350$ totalfrom harvard extension school), but it would take a while (at least a year and a half) 

&#x200B;

I guess the crux of my question lies in whether I would have more luck with the Master's, but very little professional experience, or from maybe taking a more entry level job and building professional experience. For reference, my current job is mostly wet lab-biology focused, but I do get to explore and handle some large genetic datasets - so I would be able to list that as experience.

Since most of my experience is in the biological sciences, I don't really have a frame of reference for this kind of hiring.

b6cobp,True,How to make the most out of System Analyst role,"
Hi All

 

Bit of background of my current situation. Currently pursuing a postgrad degree in data science with an undergrad in electrical engineering.


I landed a part time role as  a system support analyst at a bank where I offer support on their multiple data systems for projects as well as maintain existing VBA and SQL code to support existing systems. I aim to stay here while I complete my postgrad studies.

 

The things I’m doing right now are:

-        Adding extra features to the existing systems Excel VBA front end.

-        Remediating  and maintaining existing SQL code (Microsoft SQL Server).

-        Handling support tickets

 

The good thing about this role is I’m exposed to data every day and I get to see how data is captured and utilised in a production environment. Since this is a career switch for me (previously worked as an electrical engineer) this role I believe will be a good stepping stone.

 

My question is how can I really get the most out of this role with my career goal to be a data scientist?  

 

What skills/areas should I expose myself too?

 

I feel quite lucky to find a part time position like this and will like to make the most of it.

 

Would anyone have any suggestions?

Thank you in advance.

b8skcv,True,"2 job offers as a Data Analyst. One company has more ""mature"" processes in place. Which one should I choose?","Apologies for the sorta long post!

&#x200B;

I have 2 job offers, and I can't decide between the two. For the sake of this post, the only factor I'm interested in is growth/learning opportunity. 

Of course, before anyone can actually practice any of the exciting buzzwords of DS, the company must have a process to get/clean their existing data, turn it into a format fit for analysis, and then implement the process for the entire company to use. Once the existing processes of data circulation have been improved for good, THEN can a DA/DS do the fun parts of their job.

&#x200B;

I'm more entry-level in terms of experience. I can code my way through SQL, R, and Python, but my PROFESSIONAL experience in those languages were limited to data manipulation, data viz, and data extraction (I do have some experience creating web-based tools in RShiny and Django for my company to use). Most of my experience actually using statistics, modeling, and ML in R and Python were academic in nature (i.e. data was already cleaned up AND all the features of interest were there, so no feature engineering, no API/scraping, no DB querying needed beforehand).

&#x200B;

That's what I'd like to learn and where I'd like to grow: actually implementing those fancy algorithms I and so many others have learned, and using it to solve an actual business problem. 

One company (**Company A**) has already taken care of that whole ETL/data architecture problem: no complete overhaul of data circulation/storage/formatting necessary. That would give me more time to actually analyze the data rather than improve processes. Company A's Data department is also more mature, subdivided by different specialties of Data Science. As a Data Analyst in a more ""entry-level"" role, I'd start out doing more general work and/or writing SQL code, but I have the option to specialize in one specialty.

Furthermore, Company A has a solid mentoring system in place. I'd be paired with a more senior analyst or a data scientist in projects until I can stand on my own two feet.

&#x200B;

In contrast, **Company B**'s Data team is much less mature. It's only a fraction of the size of Company A's. The manager started a few months ago, and the director of the Data team started less than a year ago. I would be my manager's first direct report ever. Because my manager's (and hence, *my*) division in Company B is fairly recent, we'd have to build the ETL processes from scratch. In fact, during my interview, that's what we'd focus on in this job. Once processes are in place, then we can focus more on stats/modeling/the more ""fun"" parts of DS. But how long is that going to take? A few months? A year? Company B's data (at least for my job's division) reside as Excel and PPT (yes, PPT) files, in multiple Sharepoint locations. The job would entail writing scripts to clean it all up and streamline the whole process -- assuming everyone in that division is on board with making the changes necessary. It won't be that way forever, but how long is that expected to be built out??

&#x200B;

One potential advantage of Company B's job is upward mobility since it's small and young and I'd be one of the originals. Another would be impact; since we're a small team, my input would be valued.

&#x200B;

So ultimately, what I want to know is: for someone whose objective is to learn and grow in their DS skills and practice, which environment would be better? Is there any advantage of joining a younger, less-established, smaller Data team with LOTS of data cleaning to do, but with higher impact, over a larger, more-established Data team?

b9k4rk,True,Need Advice: Data Analyst Job and Self-Study/Projects or MS Statistics or ... Bootcamp,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I've been lurking on the forums for quite a while and wanted some advice. I know that this topic has been discussed to death, but would just like to know your take on my current situation.

&#x200B;

I'll give a little bit of background:

&#x200B;

1. Graduated in 2017 from UCLA (Applied Math major, \~3.7 gpa, honors). This also included coursework for nearly an entire BS in Statistics and BA in Economics.
2. Worked the following roles:
   1. Data analyst in public policy (6 months, only Python and R usage and mainly data cleaning, model implementing, and NLP)
   2. De-facto Insurance agent in a tech startup (6 months; was told I would be doing analytics worked before I was hired ... lol; some very minor, non-coding analytics projects as well)
   3. Trying my own online ecommerce store (... 6 months, lol didn't go so well and I was an idiot for having idealized entrepreneurship in my head). 
3. I have come to realize that I want to go back into data analytics and progress into a data scientist role in the future without a doubt this time. I am not currently interested in data scientist roles with heavy research components (and am not likely to be qualified for these roles for quite some time if ever), but that could change in the future.
4. I would ideally like to stay in my next role for close to a year or 1+ years, so I'm ideally not trying to take a random job or end up back in insurance. I can continue to support myself off savings until August 2019.
5. Currently been searching for 2 months and only targeting data analyst roles in the Bay Area.
6. I have the beginnings of a github portfolio (of which not having previously likely probably hindered me), and have one project done so far (time series cleaning, data visualization, and coordinate mapping), with 3-4 planned for the end of the month (NLP, classification, image processing, more data cleaning). Hopefully this will help.
7. I've been lazy with regards to my career progression and have been too wishy-washy about it previously. I've started to make other changes in my life, and in conjunction am approaching whatever the next step I take with hopefully more discipline.

&#x200B;

My options are as follows:

1. Get a Data Analyst job, continue to complete side projects, attend meetups, and apply for Data Scientist positions starting in 2020. I am currently interviewing for a few Data Analyst jobs in Silicon Valley (1 tech startup, 1 education startup, 1 consultancy). Currently unemployed for 2 months.
2. Go back to UCLA for an MS in Statistics. The program is heavily quantitative and theoretical, and is 2 years in length with a thesis requirement. Also, I can go virtually debt free or with minimal debt (<$10,000 for the program length). Finish the program and look for a Data Scientist-esque job in 2021. I've already been accepted.
3. Go apply for a Data Science bootcamp that emphasizes real-world projects and learning more technology stacks (I lean away from this since it seems like with my background I would be mainly paying for guided-ish projects). Use the rest of my savings while taking the bootcamp.

&#x200B;

Which option do you think is the best in my case? Thanks for all your advice!

b9rjeq,True,Advice regarding leaving a 'BI' job for a ML job,"Greetings,

I'd like to seek for advice regarding a situation. I'm not sure if this should be subreddit for advice but as my situation is related to the DS field, I thought it would be okay. 

I am 24M, and currently finished a master focused on DM and ML. I was having a though time finding a job in my country (not US) as ML is not that common. Making the story short, I was able to land a job as BI Developer / Data Analyst in a huge and international company. My job is with the help of our team to build the entire BI of the company, from redesigning the collection of data (from Excel to creating APIs) to presentation of data using tools like PowerBI. So far, they have me focused on designing the database models and also, preparing the BI reports (as the project already started when I wasn't here). It started like 2 weeks before I entered. Eventually they will send me to meetings to understand business questions. They are giving me the window that after that is done, we would work on implementing ML on what we built. They have been telling me that they want me to help in what I can and want. I have been working for this company for less than a week. 

Now, before getting here (a week before) I applied to one company with a position in ML (from collecting, designing and deploying ML algorithms using R, Python). It would be working under a person known here in the DS field. Company is a big company here locally. Different industry.

About benefits and salary, the ML base offer is similar to the one I am currently working. However, the one I am working has multiples economic benefits and non-economics too. Basically, the company I am currently working has a really good and better offer than the other company.

My issue is that I don't want to leave this company that has put so much trust in me with this small window, but I am afraid if being here means I won't be growing in the field. I don't want to destroy a bridge by leaving this fast.

About what I want, in my mind I want to do DS. I want to grow in my area but also helping companies in their decision area. I'd love to eventually go to US and work in the DS field. 

Sorry if something is not clear and should mention English is not my first language if any mistake show up.

TL;DR: I am struggling if I should quit a recently acquired job (less than a week) where I am helping to build the BI of an multinational company or go to work in a ML focused in a big local company.",silverasiul,22,50,1518584601.0,1587265998.923008

bbv89l,False,I wanted to go into this field and now I have serious ethical questions about ever doing so and I don't know what to do now.,"Hi. The first thing you need to know about me is that I am queer (trans/nonbinary.) This will be important shortly.

I have kind of had data science as a long-term goal for a while now because I don't know what else to do with my math degree. And then yesterday I read this.

https://reallifemag.com/counting-the-countless/

If you don't want to page through the whole thing, its thesis is that what I thought was my desired line of work is actually incredibly harmful to people like me, by way of reinforcing the gender binary and other hegemonic constructs - at such a fundamental level that even getting into DS with the intent of fixing its algorithmic bias problems and whatnot is still going to get you subsumed by a system that's way bigger than you can ever be.

If you're not queer or trans then you may not quite get just how earth-shattering this conclusion is to me. I am not exaggerating when I say discovering my gender identity saved my life. If it ever went away I would go with it. It is absolutely non-negotiable.

The piece lays out some thoughts for people in my position can do instead, but from what I can tell they're all basically ""dismantle capitalism"" (I'm not as well-read on theory as I would like to be, so a lot of it is gibberish to me) and though I would love to do that I can't accomplish very much along those lines before I graduate.

The bottom line is I would rather live in poverty for the rest of my life than have a high-paying DS job and lose sleep every night over the knowledge that I'm contributing to the slow death of people who could have been my friends.

Is there a third way? I'm 21. I live in the middle of nowhere as far as tech is concerned and I can't relocate. I'll have an MS in mathematics next year (or I'll be dead.) I'm not sure I have what it takes to do a PhD. I can code well enough but I feel as though getting an SE job wouldn't really be any better; it would just be feeding into the same system. I feel like I'm fast approaching the end of my rope. I don't know what to do.

I feel like I messed up six years ago when I got into college by way of being too young to have any goddamn idea what I want to do for myself.

(Before you say it, yes, I almost certainly have depression or some kind of malaise like that. But I don't see how seeing a therapist or taking meds or doing anything traditional like that is going to change the reality of the situation. It might make it easier for me to ignore or rationalize away my problems, but it can't solve them because they're pretty close to unsolvable.)

I'm posting this here on the off chance that anyone can help. Maybe not. I don't know.

bexm67,True,I'm (30 M) thinking about switching from psychology into data science. Do you guys think it's doable?,"Hello friends. 

Some info about my background: My first degree in in Psychology. Then I decided to do a generic MSc in Psychology again and it's when I came in touch with some basic research methodology. I learnt spss and a bit of R from the scratch and gained some experience on data analysis ( used regression, lots of Factor Analysis, some multilevel modeling on some quantitative projects).


 I was keen quantitative analysis on research but didn't engage a lot after my masters cause I got a full time job in a hospital. Two years after, I have arrived to the realization that psychology is not for me and I cannot imagine myself on this field anymore. Having this in mind and considering the fact that I liked statistical analysis, I decided to apply for a MSc in data science and analytics of Cardiff University.


 Surprisingly, I was accepted even though the requirement was first degree on a numerical subject. To be honest I am very excited by this upcoming challenge but at the same time I'm also worried that I won't be able to pull it off. I have no idea about programming, coding and whatsoever and the particular course is full of python, machine learning etc.


Do you think that shifting from a theoretical field like psychology towards data science and programming is doable on my 30s? Is prior knowledge of Algebra, calculus necessary?",jeezanthapus,92,180,1472781997.0,1587265998.923008

bfxs9c,True,Masters in Data Sicence/Data analytics for me?,"I know this questions gets probably asked a lot. I'm sorry.  


But I'm trying to know what to do in my situation.  


**Here is my situation: (sorry in advance if I put too much useless information about me)**  
I'm finishing a business degree at the moment in IT. (probably called MIS in usa I think?)  
I did some CS classes but dropped out.

**More about me:** 

I feel like in business I don't really belong since I'm not excellent at communication. I'm quiet a shy person too. Also, I find people in my business degree, kind of dumb (most of them). When I was in CS,  I felt like people were actually smart (well most of them). When I think about it, maybe I dropped CS because I was too lazy but keep telling myself I dropped out because I didn't like it. I don't know.   
I'm also introvert and like logic, problem solving, video games , etc.  


**My question is:**  
Since I don't have a STEM degree should I go for a master degree in DataScience.   
Cost is around $15-20 000 for the 2year degree. The degree includes: Algorithm for optimization and Big Data analysis, Decision analysis, forecasting methods, Machine learning, machine learning 2 , dvanced statistical learning, statistical modeling etc.  
I know some people recommend to do CS instead, but since I don't have a degree in CS. Masters in CS would be near impossible. That is why I'm considering data science/data analytics degree",alexz1993,168,676,1496362669.0,1587265998.923008

bkg6pi,True,"I need to up my game in business data analytics ASAP for my current position. I would appreciate some help deciding on whether or not a bootcamp would be helpful, or advice on how to choose one.","TL;DR at the end. I started with a company that was fairly small company a couple years ago, and long story short we’re blowing up and I moved up a lot in that time. I can comfortably call myself advanced in excel and probably intermediate in VBA. Admittedly I’m in the habit of erring towards formula-based solutions than VBA ones – I used VBA mostly for automating tasks or idiot-proofing something I’ll hand off to someone else, I end up with stupidly long complicated formulas instead. There was a lot of years of self-study that went into learning that though, I’ve worn out a few Excel Bibles to get here. Currently I mostly consolidate information across the company. I do a lot of fairly simple business analytics now, usually just helping verify and visualizing information we need that’s scattered in a hundred different places in the company. “What do we spend on X, how much revenue is generated by Z, is it cheaper long term to do this or that…” things like that. Nothing earth shattering but it has been a really good thing for the company I work for so far. 

With the way things are going my employer and I are on the same page that it’s going to be beneficial for me to feel more confident in my data analytics skills. I want to be able to do more in depth business analytics and expand beyond using excel for everything. I know I need a knowledge of Python, SQL, tableau, and just statistics in general right now. 

All that said I think I want to do a bootcamp and I have no idea where to go for it. It seems like there are hundreds to choose from and many of them are meant to compliment masters degrees or PhD’s. Prior posts here seem to be more geared towards how the certification looks on a resume which isn’t really what I’m looking for, the desire to complete a bootcamp is really because I’m just trying to be the best business analyst I can possibly be in six months from now. Cost isn’t an issue really, my employer will pay for it although I’m not looking to waste their money on the most expensive thing out there either. I travel extensively so I would need something online, full time would be hard but I can make it work for a short period of time for a good program, thankfully my employer is really supportive.
 
Where the heck do you even start when looking for a boot camp? Should I take an SQL course first? Am I just barking up the wrong tree here entirely by thinking I should do a bootcamp? I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to help me, I just started looking into it and I’m really intimidated and scared of falling for a scam. 

**TL;DR: I need an online bootcamp to take existing excel/VBA basic business analysis to the next level, would love any advice or recommendations.**",yass_cat,60,1449,1452377589.0,1587265998.923008

bl1qmg,True,Locations with the best opportunities for young Data Scientists,"To give some background on me. I am a 25-year-old junior data scientist with only about half a year of experience right now and I think with about a year at my current job I would like to maybe do something new. My current role involves both advanced analytics and machine learning. Before this job, my only relevant work experience was as a masters teaching assistant for an advanced statistics course, a course assistant for an R data analytics course, and some quantitative research assistantships. I have a strong to very strong grasp of Python and R (both for development and analytics/ds) and decent SQL. Knowledge and some experience with of AWS and Spark. I have a masters degree in a directly related area.

Now that I have given an overview of myself, I am curious where I might consider moving as a young person in this area. I have limited experience but I believe I have a pretty solid foundation to build on. I would like to start a life somewhere so both salary range as well as cost of living is a big concern. I currently live in Canada and I am not very familiar with the job market and cost of living in the US (although it appears salaries in the US are crazy high). I am also unfamiliar with the job market in Europe and Australia. 

___  

**These are the benefits of where I live now and my current job:**  
- low cost of living/rent  
- 10 min walk to work downtown  
- ~70k (CND) working in the public sector which means my salary is almost secondary to the load of benefits and incredible health coverage and insurance / pension.  
- incredible job security (strongly unionized ""job for life"").   
- I know I will be promoted early next year.   
- There may be new mandates on how we are paid, and everyone in my area would see a salary increase by default in the coming years.  
- lots of sideways movement, I can get new jobs in the public sector very easily if I want to.   
- probably the best work-life balance I could ask for and boss is very laid-back and allows me to have flexible work hours.     
- I am allowed to have a lot of time on the job to do personal training/my own work.  
  


**Downsides to current situation:**   
- I don't think I want to live in my current city for very long but it is where almost all the jobs are in the public sector.   
- my boss is leaving and it is unknown how my new boss will be.   
- oftentimes, I feel it is too slow and I could be doing more with my time.   
- the environment is pretty dim and depressing sometimes.     
- can only work from home rarely.  
- I will probably be able to earn more in the private sector, but perhaps the benefits will not be as good (not sure).    
- I believe I might be happier somewhere else in the future (which is the biggest factor for me).    
  
___  


Weighing these pros and cons, some people tell me to stick it out for sometime as it is a pretty good deal right out of school, while others say to move to other places with more opportunities once I have proven experience. I do not need a lot to keep be happy. That being said, I would like job security - that is probably the biggest supporting factor for keeping my current job. And most days, I do really enjoy my job. I think it is mainly the city I am not sure about. 

Does anyone have recommendations for me? Where are the opportunities for someone with my background? Where are the best places to look for work and build a life? Any personal experiences that are relevant?

buavr4,True,Need some perspective regarding career choices. PLEASE share your thoughts.,"I started getting into machine learning and data science a while back. I had very little idea about how each sub-fields were related to each other, and how each of them was different. I used to clump them all together as ""machine learning"", and I was not really sure which specific sub-field I wanted to pursue. I still have doubts. My efforts were all scattered. I did Andrew Ng's ML course, then did a little Data science internship (which I had to cut short midway because of reasons, but which I will be resuming soon), and also started doing Computer Vision research project in the meantime, while trying to learn Deep Learning(I was bad, but it was a ""learn on the job"" kind of a deal). I realized CV was not for me (i was never really interested myself, I just wanted to get good with deep learning).  I realized academia was not really for me, I wanted to get into the industry.  


Now, I have to admit that maths has never been my strong suit (though I used to love Probability, still like it very much), but I was/am ready and willing to learn however much is needed for doing a proper job.  


What I loved during my data science internship is : analyzing the given data to understand how a problem statements can be tackled, to decide what are the most suitable features for tackling the problem (creating new features when needed), shape them, and to finally use them to come up with a solution to a problem. I loved the LOGICAL thinking aspect of it. I found that stimulating. To think about what aspects of the data I can use to solve a problem, and the logic behind choosing those specific data. I did not have this when I was trying to work on CV. Maybe CV is just not for me.  


But on the other hand, I am not good with calculus (of course I can handle the linear algebra), and I would prefer to   
spend time on the data and manipulating it, than focussing too much on the maths (I know I need to have a good grasp of stats, working on it). Spending all day on calculus and research papers (like I had to do in CV) will make me miserable. I would like to have an active life outside of my work too (travel and stuff), and I did not find that at all compatible with the CV researcher lifestyle. Dunno how compatible it will be for data analytics/DS.

bzg43j,False,Some advice to students hoping to get into DS right out of school,"I feel the need to dispense some advice to current students eager to get into DS, and to be totally honest, it's not very positive. I do hope I'm wrong and someone else can offer a counterpoint.

Basically, for anyone in a non-PhD quantitative degree (CS, math, stats, OR, etc.), it's important to relinquish any expectation that you will be getting a bonafide entry-level Data Scientist position right out of school. The DS job market is not like the market for software eng/devs, where a lot of your CS peers will be getting offers left and right before graduation.

There are mainly two reasons for this:

1. In essence, the market for DS is much more top-heavy than the one for software devs - when Forbes or whatever talks about the huge need for DS, it's for *experienced* Data Scientists. Sadly this means that entry-level positions are limited and thus very competitive. Combined with the fact that you also have an influx of professionals wanting to get into DS from other disciplines, it makes things very messy.
2. The first reason flows out of this second reason. As you can guess from browsing this sub, DS remains a somewhat nebulous field that is inexactly defined from company to company. It encompasses BI, ML, data engineering, CS, stats, stochastic modeling, optimization, EDA, and everything in between. Most companies looking to hire entry-level software devs only need someone who can code, has good CS fundamentals, is familiar with the SDLC, and has some projects/internships to show for. There is no such well-defined path for entry-level Data Scientists, which makes it difficult for a student to decide how to invest his/her time and/or focus.

To be clear, this does not mean that it is impossible to secure an entry-level DS position right out of school - some people do. It just means that it is harder than other tech/engineering positions and should not be an expectation for aspiring Data Scientists. Otherwise, your job search will be frustrating and long.

This sub has bountiful advice for those getting into DS but I'll just rehash one of the more useful points, at least for students. Don't get into your head that you'll graduate with a six-figure offer right away. Patiently work your way into DS, whether that's starting as a Data Analyst or BI Analyst or whatever. Refine your skills on the side but don't make the mistake of thinking that doing a bunch of MOOCs, DataCamp courses, and Kaggle competitions will get you a job. They won't hurt but they will often be insufficient on their own.

I hope this helps any student looking to get into this field. I speak from my own experience and from talking with other Data Scientists. My goal isn't to be a downer but to make sure people have realistic expectations. If someone wants to offer a counterpoint/critique or the flip side, it'd be great to hear that as well.",minced314,1498,5341,1490378726.0,1587265998.923008

c3kyea,False,I enrolled in Columbia’s data science masters program and I’m having serious doubts about my decision. I would really appreciate some outside perspective,"The program is 3 semesters long, plus one summer internship/research project. It costs $60k in tuition (plus the rent cost of living in New York).

Some background on myself: I have a bachelors degree from UC Berkeley in Applied Math and economics. I graduated with a high gpa if that matters. I’ve started teaching myself to code since January of this year. Some of my undergraduate coursework included Numpy/Pandas/Scikit-learn/etc. I have working knowledge of Keras and I’ve done all the standard exercises in deep learning.

Originally I had the intention to go to a coding bootcamp, but most coding boot camps focus on full stack web development which is not what I’m interested in doing long term. I’m really interested in data science and applications of machine learning, with a broader interest in AI research so I felt that data science was a good focus for a graduate degree.

Why I’m having doubts: I’m not completely convinced that the salary benefits of this program will outweigh the costs. My priority is having a high paying stable job. I also feel like I could easily teach myself everything that’s taught in the program. I’ve gone through some sample coursework for graduate programs at schools like Columbia and it seemed on par with what’s taught at an undergraduate level stats or computer science course at Berkeley. The sole benefit of going to Columbia would be for the network/possibly higher salary due to having a graduate degree.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So in the last weeks for various reasons I have been meeting with individuals that identified as data scientists, or that had taken several courses, wether online or in a university, of data science. 

What I realized is that most of this programs do not actually provide the necessary tools for doing a correct statistical analysis. They focus on visual presentation of results and some coding (which don't get me wrong, is quite important), but they do not teach what you actually need to do a good project: statistical theory ( and maybe some maths to understand the insides of the processes, but if all they do is of an applied nature, I think this is more of secondary importance). 

&#x200B;

As a result, I have seen projects which , even if they are very pretty to look at, show a lack of understanding of some basic  ideas of statistics, such as running an OLS regression with no or few controls in a non-experimental setting and claiming to have found a causal relationship between the variables.

 In my case I can tell to an extent what is wrong with the design or methodology of the project, but I wonder, now that data science seems to be all the rage, how many people with similar skills have been hired by bussinesses that do not have people with knowledge of statistics, and as result can't know what is wrong with what they do. I know that this is not always true of course, but I worry that it might be relatively extended

I'm going to skip the back story and motivations but basically I am a Politics, Philosophy and Economics graduate (UK based) of a few years. I want to switch to Data Science. My technical skills/background is very limited, I have been completing MOOCs and studying maths via university and A level textbooks for about 8 months.

I am confident I can get into a 'Data science/analytics' Masters program in a Russell group university provided I complete the first year of a maths degree this coming year.

The question I have is: 
Should I complete the first year of the maths degree and go straight into the Masters program or complete a full undergrad before considering moving to a Masters program (if so, is a Maths major the best option)? 
Is it worth the two extra years to be more comprehensive in my learning and have that extra time to build a more signifiant portfolio? 

Also would I be at any kind of disadvantage, eventually graduating in my late 20's vs those in their early 20's?

I am graduating soon with a master in data science and my skillset/experience can be summarized as follows:

1. Statistical machine learning: the Bayesian stuff (Gaussian processes, Gaussian mixture, Bayesian inference, ... ). And other standard machine learning algorithms of course.
2. Metaheuristic optimization methods like genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, ...
3. Basic stochastic processes theory. More like from the perspective of electrical engineering, NOT finance, as in how the process is being affected when pass through systems, ... Some basic signal processing theory.
4. Databases: basic knowledge of SQL, MongoDB, Spark, Hive, and a bunch of other big-data architecture
5. Basic of deep Learning, but did NOT take Machine Vision or NLP.
6. My thesis involves processing electromyographic signals.

Basically I am thinking of myself as more of a time-series/signal kind of guy, not vision or nlp, but is willing to learn about vision or nlp if needed. I am now rather interested in working with AI/ML applications to agriculture or industrial manufacturing or even smart-city/smart-grid.

c4asvf,False,Data Analyst at a fortune500 company...not what I expected.,"So I recently got hired as in intern at this company and so far, everything they tell me to do is very vague and nonspecific.

My supervisor gave me a task to finish a ""spec"" without really clarifying it. We have a task to perform automatic summation on certain parts of the data storage place. However it's not an easy task.

The part that is frustrating is that there's no real direction. They haven't given me full access to the data storage place. Nor have they spent any time explaining how the product or data is stored or even what the column titles and abbreviations mean. Meanwhile, I'm supposed to finish this ""spec"". Every time I finish it, they change what I'm working on.

After a week I've still not had a clear direction and my final draft is supposed to be done Wednesday. They recently gave me an Excel document to solve this problem, which I did. But didn't tell me what we're going to implement it with, so no idea if my excel solving is even going to be used as it could be used in SQL. 

The job required me to know Python, R, and SQL. But so far when brining any ideas using those programs to my boss, I'm told we haven't had any plans to use any of those programs yet.

Is this normal?

Tl;dr Fortune 500 company giving me vague and unexplained tasks and has no real program language to work in.

\- minor in stats (I don't believe this programs allows double majoring, also my campus doesn't have CS minor)

\- learning Spark/R by myself, and improving on Python, Java, And SQL

\- Part of a couple information tech clubs, data lab club, public relations chair for an IST consulting club

\- I'm planning on taking the machine learning class that the engineering college offers either junior/senior year, and I currently have a little tiny bit of knowledge of AI/ML from a developers club (and I want to learn more about this on my own before I attend the classes)

\- I've attended and want to attend more coding competitions

Here are my concerns:

\- I have no job experience whatsoever, so when fall semester starts I will be looking for some sort of internship, but my GPA is not... great (thanks, calc)

\- Because I'm still 'premajor' and haven't actually started taking DS classes and whatnot, idk what to say at career fairs and when employers come to present at our school

\- I feel really ignorant to everything tech/DS related, I don't know where to find news about new tech/DS stuff, I don't know how things like GitHub works, and my clubs feel less like a learning opportunity  and more of a resume filler

#### “My life is over. I may as well become a teacher!”

The above subtitle is a paraphrasing of a line in the movie Bad Moms, in which Christina Applegate’s character succeeds in scheming to get Mila Kunis’ daughter kicked off the soccer team. Ain’t gonna lie — I laughed — but you get the drift: people who work in noble professions that have a direct impact on ***human lives*** get paid peanuts. Hey, you signed up for this, you may be thinking.

>However, sometimes we do sign up for these jobs doing God’s work in full knowledge of the pathetic number of zeroes at the end of the amount on our paycheck, because we have the naive hope that if we work hard and excel at our duties, even go above and beyond, that eventually we will be recognized for it ***in a remunerative fashion***.

Those articles you keep reading about on LinkedIn and elsewhere about Data Scientist being the sexiest job of the 21st century and paying upwards of 6 figures? I don’t know whether to laugh or cry.

After decades (yes, DECADES) of getting great performance reviews and heaps of praise from bosses and colleagues, I have yet to break that ever elusive $100k mark. I did try to explain all this to my landlord, but guess what — turns out you actually need **cold hard cash** **money** to pay for things like rent and food for your family.

#### You will NEVER move up, EVER

I had half a decade working as a statistician for Medicare in the most populous US state, followed by more than a decade as a data analyst in the country’s largest integrated healthcare delivery system operating in multiple states coast to coast. While working at said organization, I earned my MBA from the #1 university for social mobility going to classes at night over a period of 1.5 years. This added to the masters degree I had already earned before from one of the nation’s better known private colleges (hint: it was one of the #varsityblues schools. Except that I had earned my admission by winning a full tuition academic merit scholarship). I also was selected by company leadership to enroll in their internal version of a [PMP](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/project-management-pmp)/[Six Sigma Black Belt](https://www.iassc.org/six-sigma-certification/black-belt-certification/)/whatever you want to call it certification program. I was part of the only 25% of students to complete all the coursework and graduate.

Armed with all this business acumen and training to supplement my technical skills as well as medical knowledge gleaned from being officemates with a nurse practitioner, I accomplished an astonishing amount of work and projects that were well above the pay grade of my lowly data analyst title. (Btw on top of all that, I still had my day to day unsexy grunt work to do.)

>And what did I have to show for it at the end of my 10+ years there? NO PROMOTION despite several attempts at applying as an internal candidate, a piddly annual raise that was less than the [COLA](https://www.ssa.gov/news/cola/) index, and 500 hours of accrued unused PTO hours.

Yes, you read that right. That’s 62 DAYS or more than 12 WEEKS of vacay I had earned but NEVER was approved or felt secure enough to actually use. What. The. Actual. Fudge.

And this is not just employers like [Google](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html) who is reportedly the #1 culprit engaged in such chicanery (see below screenshot of an actual, unsolicited, EXTREMELY INSULTING LinkedIn message I received from the recruiting agency that they use).

This is how it usually goes after you are hired through an agency to work as a second class citizen. You either keep staying there indefinitely in the caste system as a bottom-dwelling pond scum, OR you get terminated as soon as the project you spent a few months to a year working on (sometimes during nights and weekends) crosses the finish line.

Contract-to-perm? **Don’t believe it for a second**.

#### STAY in your lane! If you stick your head too far out the window, you WILL get decapitated

Basically I got fired because I was doing my job as a consultant trying to come up with a workable solution to a serious problem in hospitals that has been written up in major medical profession journals. Built a predictive model, carefully thought about how to operationalize it, calculated the potential ROI, and presented my findings to the internal data and analytics organization. Everyone loved it, even clinical middle management who would be the direct supervisors of the nurses and hospital staff who would be implementing my proposed solution. Everyone, that is, EXCEPT the superiors of the middle managers, who had zero direct patient contact. You know, the classic out-of-touch C-suite executives making more than 10 times the salary of the typical employee occupying the nether regions of the company org chart.

Long story short, the person (which is far too generous of a word to describe this individual) *himself* was shown the door sometime after he forced my boss to discharge me. Who knows what the exact reason was, I just know it can’t have been voluntary (please refer to the last sentence of the previous paragraph. No way someone would leave a sweet deal like that of their own accord). I *did* hear from wonderful former colleagues that morale was low and turnover was high in the DNA (data n’ analytics) department. Check out the below actual Glassdoor review of a former employee at that company:

c9wozm,True,Looking to shift careers into data science,"I am a 28M with a bachelors in Philosophy and Psychology currently working as a digital media archivist so I know my way around databases but don't have any experience in SQL or python. Unfortunately my current job doesn't have much upward mobility options and as I am nearing my 30's I see the need to find a career that has options for growth. I've taken the GRE and got pretty competitive scores and have been looking at different options for possible Master's programs.

For the most part I've been looking at data analytics since that seems to fit with my background on database management. Doing anything besides online isn't financially feasible right now (still need to work full-time), and while this career path is interesting I am still not sure if it's something I can excel and have confidence in. Honestly, I don't really care about getting a super high level job, I would be totally content with a job that starts off at \~$50k and allows for mobility closer to \~$70k

&#x200B;

Here is my main question, which of the following options makes the most sense to take steps towards a career shift without adding unnecessary financial debt?

1. Just start applying to entry level jobs and spin my resume to their needs while just doing self education on SQL, python, etc.
2. Take a certification course online (I found one from Certs-School on sale for stupid cheap)
3. Take a certification course from a reputable school (e.g. Ohio State offers one I could complete in 1 school year) (est. cost \~$2600)
4. Recognize that getting a Masters is the only reasonable option and that getting $30k+ into debt can pay for itself eventually

&#x200B;

I'm thinking that no matter what I do, getting a Masters eventually would be the best move but I don't know how necessary that is before getting my foot in the door. Also getting a better paying job so I can use the extra cash flow to pay for the classes would be hugely beneficial.",ScotchMalone,755,159,1442883487.0,1587265998.923008

calp2x,True,"How to get into the field, coming from Economics?","Hey everyone! First of all, I tried to look for similar inquiries and whatnot in the sub (+ rules) before writing this, in my opinion (given also the level of detail I will provide) none do quite fit what I'm going to say, so here we are!

I write to you, fellow redditors, in the hope that you have some useful advice for me. For some context: I am a recently graduated Econ major with an interest in Data Science. For some specifics, I come from a quite decent program (top 10 in Europe), and have a normal-ish GPA of 3.1, roughly placing me in the 20% on the top, if that matters.

Although the major is econ, I have specialized in a track called Advanced Quantitative Methods where we cover some subjects like linear algebra and dynamic systems, stochastic processes, several econometrics and statistics courses, and so on. The end result is that I can handle STATA (already forgetting because I hate using it) and am fairly versatile with R. My end of bachelor's thesis is on using several covariance forecasting methods over a financial database that we constructed more or less from scratch, and got a good grade on it. I would say that the basics of the algebraic part, such as using PCA or SVD or stuff like that are quite familiar to me these days.

This is what I've got so far. No python, no knowledge about data modeling, though. What I want to do now is:

I've got a spare year in front of me, because reasons. Thanks to savings I am well enough to manage without working, so I can commit to a full year of studies. My objective is to get by 2020 to the best possible Msc in Data Science program in Europe. I have already mailed several institutions asking about elegibility given my background and got mixed answers depending on who was that replied. In most cases, I am welcome to apply but warned that usually they accept people coming from STEM backgrounds, so there's that.

I have a full year, and my intention is, by the end of it, to have an edge that allows me to first get in, and then also perform well in the Master itself. I want to do that by submitting a good GRE score along with my application (plan to commit 2 months on preparing it part time), learning some Python and maybe SQL, and generally brushing up on my math and stats, maybe getting into content from the Master itself. There are several ways in which I could do that, from bootcamp (too expensive so would rather avoid it if possible), to self-teaching. I am quite confident I could do some time as RA with my bachelor's thesis advisor, if need be.

This is it! Is that a good plan? Am I missing something? Whatever your opinion is, please say. I am looking forward to your observations and advice.",Kellsier,3430,5532,1419441319.0,1587265998.923008

Simply put, I recently graduated (BSc+MSc) in physics, but I just realized I want to start a career in DS. 

I started studying on my own, but I was also considering the option of enrolling in a program somewhere in Europe (as I am a EU citizen and from my comprehension the fees here are typically way lower). 

Ideally I am looking for a program like Information Studies: Data Science ([https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/information-studies-data-science/data-science.html](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/information-studies-data-science/data-science.html)) at Amsterdam's University. The pros:

\- 1 year long (I don't really want a 2+ year long program)

\- affordable price for EU citizens (2k euros)

\- from a city/nation with a well-established tech market

The problem is that the enrollment deadline was 1 May, so I am way too late. Unfortunately I just made up my mind and only recently understood this is what I want to do.

&#x200B;

Are you aware of any similar (public or private) program I am still in time to apply for somewhere in Europe? And - generally speaking - is it a good idea to sign up for this kind of program given the fact that I already have a quantitative degree?

Hi I'm currently doing electrical engineering and want to pick up a second major. my plan is to have data science as a career to fall on. What sounds better/what should I take.

Both the math and data science courses take all the statistics units, where we learn how to use matlab, r and spss.

The math unit has a unit on harder differential equations and numerical methods (partial differential equations which I e heard is useful in data science) also the math degree has a unit on optimisation and networks where we learn about dynamic programming and such. For some reason data science doesn't take this.

The data science unit has a unit on multivariate statistics and machine learning/ data visualisation which the math doesn't have?

As an engineer I will take all the calculus courses.

cf2ldx,True,Confused about Career Choice,"\[Long post, please bear with me, need some perspective\]  


Should I pursue Data Science/ML if I mostly enjoy coding and not maths?   


When I was starting to get into DS/ML, I was under the impression that knowing the maths, especially on a deep level, certainly helps, but is not mandatory, unless you work on research or improving algos, etc. Basically, you can do just fine with the basics (fundamentals of Linear Algebra, some stats, and some probability maybe) if you are just into applying the established algos to solve real-world problems. now, I am not so sure.  


I like the logical stimulation that coding provides (think solving problems on popular coding sites like Hackerrank and Leetcode), but not pondering over mathematical equations, and certainly not spending the day reading the latest research paper. When I did a small internship for a local startup, I liked the data wrangling, and the logical thinking aspect of feature engineering (wondering what features to use to come up with a solution to a problem, and getting that data ready to be used), but I really dislike complex calculus and stuff like that, and really don't want to spend my day beating myself up over complicated equations (I can deal with the basics, like I did Andrew ng's Ml course on Coursera).  


I would have to admit that the reason, at least one of the primary ones, for choosing this field over other programming sub-fields like software dev and web dev,  was not because I was fascinated with this field, but because of more practical reasons : good financial potential, future job security (there is really a talk about many fields like web dev dying out in the future decades, that scared me), less saturation compared to other sub-fields.

I've just graduated with a B.S. in Physics (only mentioning this because it obviously doesn't necessarily prepare me for data science or political science) but I also took several classes in scientific computing where I learned Python, C++, and Matlab. I just also took a class at a junior college in Java and I'm taking Statistics starting next month. Just throwing all of that out there to say, I don't have much training in data science, but I'm slowly getting more tools to learn! (if this is completely irrelevant, I can delete it!)

I'm really interested in how data science can be used to better understand politics and human decisions (i.e. how will climate change effect human migration into less effected countries). I'm just wondering if a Ph.d in political science (that's heavy in R and statistical modeling) would be a good way to get into this kind of research? Or if it's better to get a degree in DS directly?

So I've been working in IT at a fairly large company for the past 2 years, almost 1 of which has been solely in data. I started here when I was finishing my bachelors in Information Systems. Now that I have about a year of experience and a bachelors under my belt I've been itching to work towards a more data science heavy position. It seems that no matter where I look, roles require 3+ years experience in data. Of course I could continue to grind at my current position until the three years are up but I feel that I might start to stagnate or that I have already started to stagnate. The pay is good which makes it hard to leave but I value learning and my ability to move around to new roles more than stability. I feel that I am challenged more in this way and grow more as a result. But unfortunately I fear that if I leave, it will be hard to find another role in data as I work towards a masters. How do I leave a ""good"" job and continue to stay relevant? Should I work on my own personal projects and work towards my masters until these three years are up?

ckclk7,True,What would be the best job offers for a junior DS ?,"Hello,

I'm a very junior DS (experienced only through internships) but I'm not really into the data engineering or software engineering side, although I understand the need for it. I come from a math/ML background, definitely not CS.

I'm being presented with 5 job offers from different companies :

1. Huge company. Mid size team, with a mix of junior, associate and senior. Work is pretty generalist I would say, mostly data science, but can also be data engineering. Not so interested by the industry (for having worked on it).

Salary : +++, Location/commute : ---

2) Huge company. Very small team with **experts** in AI and DS. Work would be focused solely on ML, they have a whole other IT dept that handles all the rest (data engineering, hpc cluster, data pipelines, virtual environment, production ...). Pro : I would be doing exclusively what I enjoy the most (understanding the problem/data, collecting, cleaning, working on the data, using ML tools). Con : I would need to go through IT to install a library.

Salary : ++, Location/commute: ++

3) Mid size company. Mid size young team (lead DS must have at most 5 years of xp). They have some data engineers, and considering the business case I was given, it would indeed be focused on the ML side.

Salary : +, Location/commute: -

4) Mid size company. Very small team with mostly seniors. They warned me work would be a mix between ML and software dev, which is something I'm definitely not interested in (it's not like I tried either).

Salary : ++, Location/commute: --

5) Small company, mid size team. They told me they only work with decision tree for explainability. Writing about this, I think I'm already discarding this offer.

Salary : -, Location/commute: +++

Right now, I'm favoring 2) because it looks like the best opportunity to keep learning about ML without having to worry about stuff I personally find boring, but also because the salary offer is one of the best out of the 5 and location/commute is very good. But I'm wondering if it's the right choice considering how little experience I will get on non-ML related skills. Wouldn't this be an issue for my overall career ? Or will I still be able to catch up if need be ?

I've been supporting myself working part-time during school and full-time this Summer working as a server but I'm realizing now how fucked I might be for the upcoming job hunt. 

There's a possibility I may be able to take out a pretty friendly loan from some family members so that I can quit my serving job and focus on projects and looking for internships.

But school gave me an overview of several topics. 

Data structures and algorithms class taught me the sorting algorithms, recursion, evolved recursion(dynamic programming), and the space-time trade off for various data structures...but I only had a few assignments to internalize the several concepts I was taught. 

Preparing for interviews and learning how to code these concepts taught me so much more. For one, I had to implement all of these from scratch and I practiced them much more than once or twice(unlike in school). I was also exposed to many more algorithms thanks to geeksforgeeks and the interview questions I had. 

My initial data science class taught me how to query from api’s, create visualizations, some linear/logistic regression and use Hadoop for a bigram word counts. 

But studying for interviews taught me these same concepts in much more depth and gave me much more muscle memory. 

Same with sql- my school never had a proper class on sql- we had one group project for a client where we dabbled in sql a little

It was only after practicing sqlzoo and hackerrank that I actually even truly understood sql.

Is it actually necessary? How powerful would a ‘normal’ computer have to be to be able to do the analysis (the most demanding process I imagine will be topic modelling with k < 50). My 8gb RAM, 256gb SSD mac book has been fine with a corpus of 200k tweets, what would the specs need to be to handle this dataset? 

How does one prepare the code before going in? Given I won’t have seen the data beforehand (although have a good idea what it’ll be like and have done sample code for that) and I’ll be limited on time, what’s the best way to prepare the code in advance? 

Will R start to experience any problems with a dataset of that size? 

Thanks

Hello everyone,

I   am research master of economics student in one of the leading  universities in Europe, during my bachelor I took two  courses about R  and I have two short internship experience(each of them  was 2 months)  and my responsibilities can be considered as 'data  analyst' who uses R.  During the first year of the master I took three  econometrics courses  in which we focused on linear regression, logistic  regression, time  series and panel data. Hence, I believe that my  econometrics knowledge  and background are good.

In the  second year, I will take two data science courses in which we go through   Elements of Statistical Learning and Introduction to Statistical   Learning books, plus I will also take two micro-econometrics courses,  one is theoretical and the other is applied.

So,   do you think that this background is enough for being data scientist? I   believe that I should experience more in the application aspect,   especially for coding. What should I do more in order to survive in the   industry? Do I need learn Python, my opinion is that improving my R  skills will be more efficient than learning Python from knowing nothing,  is this true?

Your comments and suggestions are more than welcomed and very  valuable for me..

Thank you.",Miriel18,73,36,1546780495.0,1587265998.923008

Hi all,

Long time dweller, first time poster on this sub. I recently graduated with an M.S. in applied statistics (undergrad B.S. in stats) and got hired at the company I interned/worked part time at the past two years while I finished up undergrad and grad school.

The position is pretty nice, and my role is basically being ""the"" analytics guy for a department within the company, so imagine building A LOT of dashboards/helping managers see how their business is doing and make decisions based on that. I already know that this job is going to require a pretty firm knowledge of SQL and relational databases, and using tools like tablaeu as well (not a lot of cool data science stuff...yet). 

I'm definitely going to try and incorporate tools like Shiny R when I begin full time, but I was wondering if anyone on this sub had advice on how to really hit the ground running with my first full time job? I'm already anticipating staying late at the office learning SQL basics and working my chops with python and R (I did a good amount of programming with these in grad school, but it definitely isn't as intensive as a full time job will be).

Any resources you swear by? Any particular books/websites/online courses to take? Any tips on automating reports since we seem to be in the ""Excel Workbook/VBA"" stage in terms of our analytics?

Basically how do I become the best data analyst I can be so I can take care of more ""minor"" tasks that take an experienced data scientist 5 minutes instead of 5 hours so I can start focusing on the more challenging and interesting stuff? I know this job is a lot more of the 'data analyst' position, but I just need to know how I can eventually build myself to put myself in the best position to be a data scientist.

Dear Sir/Madam,

Your position for a quantitative research intern is of great interest to me. I am a third-year physicist at Imperial College London with programming knowledge looking to gain experience in the data science industry. I am certain that with my skillset I can be a great addition to your team.

An internship at Impact Information Company has given me a glimpse into what a career in data science and quantitative research will entail. A large portion of my time was data wrangling which taught me how to handle unprocessed data and how to manipulate it to achieve the desired results. The unprocessed data was analysed further through web scraping and applying Natural Language Processing alongside a machine learning algorithm to fit our specific requirements. I then applied this data to automatically create Tableau workbooks for clients based on the specific data required by each client. Time series analysis was then conducted on data in postal districts across the UK to predict the growth of industries and how social investors can impact the growth in a positive manner. My skills showed great improvement and were indispensable to the company, so I was asked to continue working even after completing the internship.

Completing the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate has provided me with the skills needed to further flourish in data science. I can now build machine learning models such as KNN, k means clustering, logistic regression and evaluate their effectiveness as well as being able to refine the models to be able to achieve the highest accuracy for the relevant data. I can also apply extensive statistical analysis to the results to be able to determine how well it fits the desired outcome.

My background in a scientific environment alongside my enthusiasm for programming and data analysis make me a suitable candidate for this position. My experience will allow me to contribute to G Research while learning and gaining invaluable experience about the practical applications of quantitative analytics in the industry.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope to hear from you soon.

daxwf4,False,Mid career advice for an ML generalist: Update,"[A few weeks ago I posted that I was having trouble with mid-senior level interviews.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/d0qz6h/mid_career_advice_for_an_ml_generalist/) Since then I’ve changed a few things and had much better responses (3 onsite invitations and 2 offers). I've just signed an offer that I’m pretty happy with, and wanted to update you on some of the things that I think helped the most.

# Company size

I was applying pretty randomly to a lot of different size companies, turns out my sweet spot seems to be startups with 10-20 employees who don’t have an ML manager yet. (I don't have enough management experience to go for manager roles at larger companies). I think this is because I’ve had too many experiences with bad managers that I don’t really trust them, so I probably put out a prickly vibe in interviews that puts people off.

# Age(ism)

I do a lot better when interviewed by older people, like 40-50+, they seem to have more respect for my PhD and life experience rather than just trying to catch me out on something I don’t know off the top of my head. Luckily the tech bubble (e.g. 20-year old founders of [juice startups](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2017/09/01/silicon-valleys-infamous-400-juicer-startup-is-shutting-down/)) is settling down, I think I read somewhere that most successful startups are actually founded by 40+ year olds, so hopefully the industry will go more back to the way it was in the 80s and 90s.

# Statistics

I’ve never really got statistics on a deep level (my PhD is in pure math) so have always struggled with stats questions in interviews, e.g. “there are two groups of users each one does a certain number of clicks per day, how do you know if one is more than the other.” Stats just seemed like a random bag of z scores and t tests and I don’t even really believe in p-values; I’d remember enough to stumble my way thorough, and then say something about bootstrapping confidence intervals when I couldn’t, but it made me come across as pretty weak. What turned it around for me was reading “Statistical Rethinking” by Richard McElreath: writing out the equations for statistical models gives me confidence when I’m talking ( I come from a math background) and then I can just say that I would run MCMC to get the coefficients.

I’ve also screwed up a few interviews with time series data from sensors (outlier detection etc) ... I still don’t really know how to approach these.

# ML models

This was one of the biggest things I was doing wrong in retrospect. When I was asked “tell me something you’ve done that you’re proud of” I’d tell stories about powerful business results I’d achieved using simple models like heuristics, logistic regression or random forests together with more organisational things like clarifying metrics and objective functions with stakeholders, product/design thinking, evolving data-labeling practices, and testing models in production as soon as possible.

Lol turns out people don’t want to hear about any of this, maybe it made them think that I just plug data into a black box and don’t understand how it works? Anyway things turned around for me when I dropped all the business stuff and started just talking about (the one time) when I read a research paper, implemented the algorithm in PyTorch and got a meaningful gain in accuracy.

# Engineering

You guys were right, I didn't need more engineering experience, I'm already pretty strong for a data scientist, I was just doubting myself due to my current company (which doesn't have a data science org) gaslighting me into taking a lower pay grade.

Anyway hope this is useful to some of you, definitely going to approach my next job search differently although maybe things will be different by then anyway and I might be going for more management-level roles.

dbrtw0,False,Data Science Manager Knowledge,"Hi all,I am just curious to know what do you think are the essential topics a data science team's Manager should know. By knowing I am not saying they should be proficient in using them, just understanding what something is and potential applications.

I recently switched jobs( a few months) and the current analytics manager used to be a business controller (That's ok). Apparently he used to be a data scientist/analyst,  but what I find puzzling is that he doesn't know anything about... well whatever is going on in data science.He doesn't know anything about python, sparks, MLflow, AWS .Barely knows anything about any kind of models, he knows neural nets exist and are useless, he might understand be able to compare a random forest with logistic regression...maybe.

I am fine explaining things to non-technical people on non-technical terms, but I believe I need to be able to talk to my manager about my tech needs and what resources I need in order to do my job.

Is such a person even qualified to lead a team of data scientists? Should I just look for another job at this point? Everyday it gets more frustrating.Needless to add he doesn't even seem interested in the subject at all, I feel like he is there to collect a paycheck.

EDIT:

I think as people have said I need to give more context, and probably it was just a venting post due to my accumulated frustration.  
A little bit of context: we are a medium sized company building up our data infrastructure and trying to move to predictive analytics from what has been historically mostly descriptive work on our customer behavior.   


Communication example goes like this (Note that I am a junior so I am expecting to develop my skill set) :  
  I am having trouble with training a model (time wise) and I notice my code is running on a single core. I ask them if they ever encountered the same problem before and if so what solution was implemented. -> Never happened. Asks me what am I using and I say sklearn. Doesn't know what that is and I explain it's a ML library for Python.  


 Or for example we talk on how we should do analysis. I propose we automate at least part of the data cleaning/diagnostics and build a library for special statistical tests that we have to do. Basically met with empty fish gaze. Um.. so that requires a lot of time you don't have, uh?

I’m currently nearing graduation (~2 months) from a Business/ Business Analytics program (it’s basically the new name for their Management of IS program with a more analytical focus). I have a 3.8 GPA, machine learning work experience at a major company for a year and would consider myself to have the necessary sql/excel knowledge for entry level positions. I also have experience working with Python and more extensive experience with R and Tableau. Additionally, I am bilingual and have varied experience in healthcare and volunteer work (not related but I believe it shows a well-rounded applicant). 

I get *very* few responses and the few I do, have been rejections. I’m applying all over the country. Chicago, New York, Austin, all over California, Denver, even random smaller places, too. Really just everywhere although I do have my heart set on some areas more than others (Colorado and Texas primarily). I’m currently in south Florida but 
1) hope to leave here
 2) there isn’t much of an industry here, really

I believe my resume is pretty solid (although I am open to feedback). I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. For the last couple months I’ve made an effort to apply to minimum two jobs a day. On most days I’ll net 5-10 applications. I really don’t know what I’m doing wrong. 
I always include a cover letter that I’ve perfected based on feedback and lots of Reddit career help research and a stellar reference letter from a major employer (working on getting more reference letters). 


Another thing seems to be that most positions are looking for really experienced analysts. Is there another title I should be looking at? I’ve even applied to multiple associate and junior positions to no avail. 


I am in the process of trying to begin working on some projects since I’m wondering if maybe that’s the issue? I don’t have a portfolio or anything—I guess I just get confused as to what that would look like and worry it would do more harm than good (would it look too elementary or something to that degree). 


I would appreciate any help as I’m becoming pretty anxious. I know these things take some time and there are tons of qualified folk out there but I would really love to secure something in the coming months before I graduate. I’m wondering if that’s an issue too- do people hire fresh grads anymore? And especially those living in other cities? 

I would seriously appreciate any advice you can offer.

I do stuff such as:

- Predictive analytics eg: predicting / classifying pipes with leaks using basic algorithms on sklearn, and time series on supply/demand energy forecast (mostly ARIMA and VAR, not even GARCH since supply/demand for water and power aren't that volatile). I don't use deep learning stuff like tensorflow / keras. Most of our problems aren't that complicated.

- We also do ad hoc requests eg: scraping twitter for certain hashtags and create a map for sentiment analysis for our public relations group.

- Sometimes we develop dashboards using tableau.

- A lot of times I use ArcGIS/QGIS to do spatial analysis.

- Sometimes I do ETL using alteryx.

- My coding skills aren't impressive. I know a little R and I use python more often because it integrates better with GIS stuff. I know a little bit of PostGIS, although I use QGIS/ArcGIS a lot more often. I don't come from CS background. My undergrad was in civil engineering and I have masters in applied econ/econometrics.

As I am still learning data science so there may be some mistakes in my implementation/ approach and I highly appreciate your opinions, points, suggestions, modifications.

I am working on a leading financial services company and for their premium users, I need to implement personalized news.

Through I have found out some idea how to approach the problem, I don't know whether my idea is actually the workable solution or not.

**Problem Statement**: Recommend user's news articles.

**Data**: user's personal information such as age, login time, portfolio information, topics that users have high affinity to.  ( this is still WIP still suggestions on data would be beneficial)

&#x200B;

**Solution**: 

Steps

1. ***Finding readers with similar interests:***

As we have mixed data we will be using [hierarchical clustering algorithm using the Gower](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/15313/260511) similarity coefficient.

It will help to group similar users who have similar tastes.

&#x200B;

**2.** ***Topic modeling***

 To understand news articles we will use the [LDA algorithm](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/news4u-recommend-stories-based-on-collaborative-reader-behavior-9b049b6724c4) to identify topics in news.

 We can also use it to understand how much a news article is relevant to the topic.

 To identify the diversity of topics I will use Jaccard similarity. as we do not want many topics and similar topics.

&#x200B;

For mapping news with users, we will use the number of clicks of the user on particular news containing the topic.

&#x200B;

**3.** ***Recommendation***

As we have a Group of clusters which has information about their affinity toward the topic, 

we can find out similar news article which is similar to the topic using [cosine similarity](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/cosine-similarity/) and recommend that article to the user group.

 

Again any doubt/ change/ modifications are appreciated.

dfgcps,True,Seeking career advice," Hi all, I have been working at a start up for over a year as a data scientist. 

Like with any startup, it has its problems. But like any hype around AI, everyone thinks everything can be done. 

When I first started, there was no training whatsoever. The problem is not only with poor management but also poor collection of data. Since start of the year, company has wanted to venture into NLP (and computer vision), but to date after going rounds in circles we only have limited number of documents to work with. They don't have an exact procedure of doing things, and with limited data its also equally hard for me to do things. 

Sometimes they change objectives extremely fast. Today I could be working on some computer vision problems, next week they could be asking me how far we are into it. The following week they might think we are wasting time and change their objectives. Either they have no concept that each problem is not trivial or I am dumb… 

Each time I change to work on a different problem, I have to switch context which is taxing on its own. This has happened many times. They are eager to launch a product sure, but without thinking if first of all the problem has a good solution. 

Its reaching a breaking point for me as I feel I am getting nowhere with my career. Can anyone tell me how to deal with it? I am not sure if its weakness on my part that these are common occurrences in startups data science job or not. I am thinking of leaving and have X months saved up so financially wise its not too big of an issue though if i stay unemployed too long It does.

So, I have some acne. It's not bad by any means, but it's certainly there, and I would like to get rid of it. I know this doesn't sound like it has anything to do with data but hear me out. So I wash and moisturize my face twice a day, and for most people that's all they need to have a clean face. But my face still breaks out. I think it might be from my habits rather, like diet and how often I touch my face. I've been thinking lately, maybe there is a way that I can record my habits everyday as data, and measure them against how many pimples I have on my face in the following days. So I am planning on recording things like how many times did I touch my face today, grams of sugar, stuff like that, and also keeping note of the acne on my face. Eventually I hope to look at the correlation between things like how many times I touched my face vs. how many pimples I got the next day or so. My one problem is the number of pimples ""in the following days"". Because this is supposed to be about the lag in effect of variables on my acne, i.e. touching my face more than usual on Tuesday lead to more pimples than usual on Friday, and not simply y=2x where I could use multi-linear regression, I am stumped as to how I could do this. I've heard about time series before and how they deal with leading indicators; is this the way I should go? Or is there something simpler I can use? For context, I know R very well, and python some. Ideally I am looking for a package or something for R Studio, as I am well-versed in how it functions. Any other suggestions for subs I should put this into would be nice as well.

dmoht4,False,Quick notes on applying to entry-level analyst/DS roles,"Hey all

Just wanted to share three quick pointers I think might be valuable as someone who got an entry level analyst role on a data science team at a start-up and is now hiring for one:

1) *Data cleaning, data cleaning, data cleaning*: These are the golden words on the resume. Most companies today are trying to apply ML to really complicated real-world problems, which means messy data. If you talk about experience where you have cleaned messy real-world data in detail, that will put you ahead of other candidates.

2) *Generic Projects*: We all know them: housing price regression, MNIST, the flower one, Twitter sentiment analyses, MovieLens recommendation system, etc. Having done these isn't *bad* necessarily, but to someone with who has been around the block of online machine learning courses, these aren't all that impressive. Filling out your resume with original, even if they are relatively simple, projects and models that incorporate data cleaning is much more attention-grabbing.

3) *Why??*: I don't really mind people who message me on LinkedIn, deduce my work email or go to the effort of writing cover letters but you aren't really doing much for yourself if all you are saying is ""Hey I saw the job, I think I am qualified, can I have the job?"". That is what everyone who is applying is saying, you're just being more annoying about it. If you look into our company, even just regurgitate our mission statement in your cover letter, it at least shows you aren't just spraying and praying. I would be more likely to consider someone less qualified who communicated why they want this job, not just a job.

dwwfji,False,Am I deluding myself thinking my skill set warrants a career switch to DS?,"I am 5 years into my career as a business consultant and have climbed up the ladder to manager (project lead, team lead,involved in hiring and promotion decisions, etc.).

While I generally enjoy doing strategic consulting my real passion is data analysis.

Over the last two years I have prioritized evolving from run-of-the-mill market research analysis towards using more advanced analytics. I use R & Python now instead of SPSS, train ML models (Random Forest, Xgboost, etc.) instead of simply multivariate analysis and have dipped into advanced stuff like neural nets,etc.

I`d really like to switch towards a pure data science role because I like the work and want to get away from consultant work hours.

However in the end I do not have a CS background and while I understand the basics do not have time to really get familiar with stuff like SQL,non-analytics Python and possible languages to prototype apps and front-ends. From a practically stand point my current work really only focuses on analytics (based on mostly available data) as well as the strategic context (which questions to ask, what to do with the answers as well as consulting business on how to develop DS capabilities). None of the models I developed have ever been put into production for example.

I don`t think that would be a problem if I want to switch towards entry level data science but I feel with my business and management background I should aim higher (even if just to avoid a wage downgrade).

Taking this all together I do not know whether I am actually skilled and desirable enough for the senior level data science roles I covet.

What do you think?

Update:

Data Engineering: 1/5

Data Analytics: 5/5

ML/AI: 3/5

Right now, I am in my third year of an engineering physics major with co-op, and am on track to graduate in 5 total years (this is with \~12 month work experience as part of the coop program). However, the coop position I am likely going to accept is more along the lines of applying software engineering/data science to a research problem. I have come to realize that my career is heading towards that direction, rather than engineering physics, and am feeling a bit stuck in my current major. I have a couple options:

1. Switch majors into a program with a stronger emphasis on software engineering and data science. I have the OK to do so, but it would add one year onto my graduation time, meaning I would graduate in 6 years from my initial enrolment at university. However, doing this would allow me to also have the space to add a minor into my degree, and I have a strong interest in math and am thinking it may be a good idea to add that as a minor.
2. Remain in engineering physics, graduate in the standard 5 years, and hope that employers and graduate programs in computational math / data science would accept me despite my degree not being in these areas.

Assuming finances are not an issue, is there a clear better option here? My worry about the first one is that taking 6 years to finish undergrad (5 years of coursework + 1 year of industry work) might be a red flag in master's applications (and possibly to employers too?), even though I did change majors fairly late. But, I'm hesitant about the second option because I have to make a fairly significant leap between engineering physics and computational math / data science, and I feel like it's more of a risk in terms of finding employment or getting into a master's program.

Do grad schools generally care about how long your degree took? Or is it more important that your degree is as closely related to the field as possible? Or, are neither of these as important as grades, research experience, etc.? Thanks so much!",infinitentropy,99,101,1530221234.0,1587265998.923008

Advanced excel

Python programming 

Front end web visualization (HTML/CSS)

Fundamental statistics

Databases (MySQL and Mongo)

Advanced topics (tableau, Hadoop and machine learning). 

At the end as part of the course we will also work on a project that will be added to a portfolio. 


My background is in chemistry (Bs) and pharmacology (Ms) and I am currently working in the pharmaceutical industry. I have very little coding experience but the boot camp is tailored towards beginners like me. 


So do you think the skills covered in the boot camp will be enough to obtain at least an entry level job?

In addition, do you recommend someone from a physical science background to go into data science/analytics given how competitive the field seems?

e2en0j,False,Failed a job interview - Was my approach wrong?,"So I currently work as a data scientist, and I recently failed a data science job interview at a large professional services firm. 

The feedback from my interview was that I came across very well, but that I failed on the technical test.

The technical test was to do a Powerpoint presentation of how I would deduplicate a dataset of 10 million rows which contains information such as name, address ect where some of the rows are fuzzy duplicates of other rows. There was no limit placed on the type of approach or packages used. The task was presented as a business problem, 'we need to call individuals in the dataset to get consent to keep their data, we don't want to call the same individual more than once. We have an approaching deadline.'

My approach was to preprocess the data,  split it into chunks, deduplicate a chunk, and then systematically compare the deduplicated chunk with other chunks, and iterate the same process through the remaining chunks.

In the feedback from the interview they said the main reason why I failed is that for the within-chunk-deduplication and comparison-with-other-chunks parts of the process I used a [pre-built package](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html#introduction) rather than building one from scratch myself.

To me, building one myself is a waste of time, as I would just be recreating something that already exists. But obviously they thought I did the wrong thing. 

In case something like this comes up again, I would be interested to hear what others think, did I do wrong by using an existing package? Or did they do wrong by expecting candidates to approach the task and not try to time-optimise the approach?

A bit about me. I am wanting to transition out of academia (Bioinformatics, more precisely) into data science type roles. However, I'm really unsure of how to ""sell myself"" in terms of data science skills, and all the CVs I have done up until now have been academic (much longer and much less 'punchy').

I'm proficient in Python and R (I use both of these every day). I build a lot of pipelines (with snakemake) and I scale these from local computers, through to the servers and HPC that we have onsite. All visualisations I create myself in ggplot/matplotlib, and I do a variety of statistical analysis on clinical metadata (I'm a Bioinformatician in a hospital).

I feel like I'm not pitching myself correctly at all, and I'm just generally unsure of this entire process.

There are several questions at the end of this post that I’m looking for concrete answers to.

**The context**

I started a specialized diploma in applied computer science in 2012, got super interested in data science and dropped out to pursue a self-study path through Coursera, just before MOOCs were mainstream. I have been working in the software industry for seven years: 3 years as a software engineer and 4 years as a data scientist. Unfortunately, I’ve been the only data scientist in the three different organizations I’ve been employed at and haven’t had the opportunity to grow as a professional data scientist (which isn’t to say I have grown as a data scientist or professionally).

Within a professional context, I have learned a lot about business, business and data strategy, scoping data problems, and software development and have had the opportunity to work on a lot of end-to-end data problems (none of which made it to production). Ultimately, I don’t feel like I’ve delivered much tangible value to the organizations I’ve worked at while in a data scientist role. My work has mainly positioned them well with POCs and educated them on internal and customer-facing use cases. I’ve also never had anyone validate my approaches or results - the closest I get are responses from the online community to questions I post when I’m really stuck.

Over the past few years, my understanding of applied predictive analytics (ML in the context of real world problems) and inferential statistics has improved mostly from countless hours of learning concepts and speaking with business stakeholders. It pains me to say I’ve completed a total of three portofolio-worthy projects which are mediocre at best (e.g. achieving an F1-Score of .73 on a real-world multi-class classification task I completed for work) and have only participated in two Kaggle competitions, ranking low on the leaderboards. I’m totally aware that more of my time should have been spent completing projects and building my portfolio rather than learning. Reflecting on my interest in learning over implementing has hinted toward the fact that I will probably enjoy a career in research.

So all of this, coupled with a strong interest in AI (more agent-based models rather than DNNs, like the content in AIMA by Norvig and Russel), statistics, biology, math, and solving hard problems has me seriously considering going back to school to complete an undergrad then post-grad programs. I’m sure being jaded has something to do with it, but I’ve become quite depressed at thought of the path I’m on, being stuck in this data science-team-of-one-with-no-production-projects role. Even if I get to do ""real"" data science, I don’t like the thought of working directly on impacting the bottom-line. I want to do *science,* work on the cutting edge, and have a larger impact with my work. I’m fine if my work indirectly impacts the bottom line.

**The plan**

1. Completing my diploma in Q2 2020 with a comprehensive project to demonstrate my industry experience
2. Going back to school in Q3 2020 to complete my CS BSc within with stats minor in 1.5 years - 2 years (thanks to a local college / university partnership that I qualify for after completing #1)
3. Enrolling in a MSc program in 2022
4. Hopefully fast-tracking to a PhD program by 2023
5. Getting an (ideally) high-paying research position as a scientist doing work that I’m passionate about by 2028

My goal is to do applied research for a big tech firm like Microsoft, DeepMind, Netflix or a company working on precision medicine like [https://www.deepgenomics.com/](https://www.deepgenomics.com/).

I want to clarify that my motivation for doing a PhD is not money-driven, but I am expecting that my hiatus from full-time employment for 8 years will pay off from a financial perspective, in the long-run. To be clear, I’m interested in a PhD because I want to be immersed in a field of study that I’m passionate about, become an expert in it, and do proper applied science in that field. I feel that going back to school will also help develop my critical thinking skills which I feel could use some work.

Here is where it gets tricky:

* I’ll need to work part-time at least while I finish my undergrad degree (thinking 20 hours / week)
   * This might be possible at my current employer, definitely doable at a previous employer. Also considering freelancing on sites like Upwork.
   * My strategy is to negotiate a higher salary to offset reduced work hours.
* I want to get married and start a family within the next 5 years
   * My girlfriend and soon-to-be fiancé (she doesn’t know it yet) is ultra-supportive of this move.
* I still want to make >= $150K annually (after completing my PhD) to support the lifestyle I want for me and my (future) family
* The computer science department at the nearest university doesn’t appear to have strong AI research areas (see [https://www.csd.uwo.ca/research/ai\_\_games.html](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/research/ai__games.html))

**My questions for you**

Career:

* Does this sound like a reasonable path to take, given my career trajectory to date and passion for research? Am I sabotaging my career? To provide some more context, data scientists are in low demand in the area (lots of tech companies but most are late majority / laggards when it comes to creating a DS capability) and are paid less than software engineers.
* Are there still going to be lucrative career opportunities in AI in the next five to ten years for a 37-40 year old, doing ultra-specialized work in e.g. computational genomics?
* If I complete a PhD in a focussed area like computational genomics as opposed to machine learning / deep neural nets, will the big tech companies still consider me for research positions?
* One of my biggest fears is that by the time I’m done my PhD, technology will have advanced so much that either my expertise will become outdated or the problems will have already been solved. Is this a rational fear?

Academic:

* My math isn't great, should I look at doing a minor in math instead of statistics?
* What are some open research areas in AI that excite you and that will still be relevant in the next ten years? I want to future-proof my research ambitions in the best way that I can.

When the data need is purely operational, it is easy to be data driven. Ex : if an employee X sells significantly less than the average, you can ask him why and work with him. But when it comes to high-level strategic decisions, it is a completely different game. Even if data tells that we are losing money in a product Y, if the company believes in it and sees it as the future, it will continue funding it.

e7r2ni,False,"When you were a new Data Scientist, how quickly did your responsibilities increase and when did it warrant a salary increase?","TLDR: New fresh-grad MSc. in my first job as an Associate Data Scientist. Responsibilities grew to that of a normal Senior Data Scientist within 6 months and will double by the beginning of next year. If a promotion isn't possible, how can I make the most of my situation, whether increasing compensation, refusing too much work, etc?

Hi guys,

I'm in a bit of precarious situation and I hope you guys would be able to help. I'm a new age Data Scientist (mix of Business Intelligence using SQL/R/Python/Tableau and using ML for impact analysis, but no data engineering or production-level ML modeling). At the beginning of this year, I left academia (previously PhD. Candidate) with an MSc. in electrical engineering. I applied and was accepted into a big funded start-up (think Alibaba level). From the long interview process, I was rated as barely a Senior DS; worried that I couldn't keep up due to my lack of experience, I pushed to become an Associate DS with a salary close to a Senior DS (based on my market analysis), which was accepted.

However, in the span of 6 months, I went from working with 1 Product Manager (PM) with 1 product to 2 PMs with 3 products. Now, by end of January, due to reorgs (no layoffs though), I'm now asked to **solely** handle 6 PMs with 9 products. According to my company's DS career ladder, I'm qualified to be a Senior DS when I work with 2-3 PMs and 4+ products, and these requirements are pretty consistent with the actual responsibilities of the Senior DSs I'm friends with. However, my manager has already stated that while a promotion is ""on the table"", I likely don't have the work experience nor enough time spent in the company to be considered for a promotion yet. Promotions requires multiple levels of approval, so it isn't purely based on my manager's discretion.

If a promotion isn't possible anytime soon, is it possible to ask for a salary increase or refuse part of the increased responsibilities? My responsibilities and products has increased dramatically in terms of scale, scope, and complexity (from minor, add-on features to features handling a ton of our revenue), let alone dealing with constant stakeholder management and context switching due to the highly varied products. I want to accept the increased responsibilities, but I myself am not sure whether I can handle everything; I feel like my current limit is 5-6 products, but I did grow from struggling with 1 product to comfortably handling 3 products in 4 months. Would talking to the Head of DS department help? We have done multiple skip level meetings in the past, but not for a sensitive topic like this.

What would you do in my situation? Let me know if there's a better place to ask for advice. I think this is an appropriate place due to being relatable and maybe a question on many DS's minds, given the constant influx of new talent into the industry.

EDIT: During my salary negotiation, it was agreed upon that I would mostly be  working at local-level projects, so I was given a local salary. My MSc. is from a top 20 US university, but I work in a 3rd world country, while the headquarters is at a 1st world country; thus, my salary is 4-5x less than my headquarters counterparts. In my last quarter, I was indeed only working on 1 local product/feature. However, this quarter, I worked on 1 local and 1 regional-level product/feature. I needed to fly to the headquarters cross-country at least once  a week per month. Now, by the end of January, they'll be expecting me to work on 1 local and 8 regional products/features. I'll likely need to fly over at least 2 weeks per month to maintain my quality/speed of work and for effective stakeholder management. Thus, there's also a local vs regional component to my issue.",royalon,402,398,1444060562.0,1587265998.923008

I am currently in the first semester of my Industrial Engineering MSc. and taking Optimization (LP), Stochastic Processes and Network Models & Optimization. I graduated from IE but my uni was more focused on more business-y stuff. For my research I am most probably going to use dynamic programming and machine learning, for my thesis. On the other hand, I have an interest in data science and before starting my MSc, I was going through another certificate program in data analytics (quitted b/c the program was provided to me via the job I held at that time, I quit that job, it was a temporary one for me and also it did not lead to better opportunities imo). I know intermediate level of Python and Excel VBA (which is almost nonexistent in DS as far as I know?), and took predictive analytics and data analytics courses in my BS. I was aiming to pursue a PhD in the US, UK or the Netherlands in the field of IE/OR and be an academician, but I realized I ABSOLUTELY HATE dealing with students, not for me. So I am checking the job listings where there is demand for OR graduates (my program is focused on OR) and realized there are few in my country. However, there are a lot of DS jobs out there. In the uni I do my masters, there is also a new DS masters program and idk if I should swap or not.

So my question is, how common is to hire a MSc. IE graduate to DS jobs? Why there are just a few jobs out there for IE MSc.'s as research engineers? Or, is it not that few but I did not come across such? (I don't live in the US or UK, that might be a reason.) Is it logical to have a second MSc. degree in DS and first finish MSc. in IE?

But even as I do my research to see what I need, all my colleagues who are in Data/AI part of the project seem to be extremely smart.

I guess my question is, how long would it take for me to get to a point where a university would be willing to take on a student that does not have an engineering background?

Or do I absolutely need to another bachelor degree. (My original plan was to do a MSc in Data science or some Masters in Data Engineering).

ebyx83,True,At a career crossroads: Positioning myself as a consultant in a Big4/ACN/ATK's DS Practice,"TLDR: Have scratched surface of DS with some related projects and courses, but unsure how/if I should further specialize in context of working in a business tech/management consulting firm.

&#x200B;

Hey everyone, I'm on track for a promotion from generalist college-entry analyst > practice-aligned consultant at a global tech consulting firm. I've had a variety of experiences in my first two years (Change management, UX, solution arch, etc.) including roles tangentially related to DS, (Data governance, small-scale non-prod python webscrapers, logistic regression & K-Means Clusters for client innovation workshops) but not a ""true"" end-to-end hypothesis-driven or productionized DS/ML project. I'd really appreciate your thoughts on how I intend to position myself and whether specializing in DS makes sense for someone like me.

Ideally, I want to position myself at the intersection of business strategy, Human Factors (UX, Employee Experience & Change Management), and DS/ML. My dream role would involve being the connective bridge/Product manager that can intelligently interact and leverage the skills of DS SMEs, and connect that to the specific business requirements & tradeoffs /stakeholder management/ product feature prioritization of a client engagement. 

Is this a realistic way of positioning myself as a business technology consultant first, but a data scientist second? I realize that my math and stats background are rather underdeveloped compared to an in-house/Full time data scientist, but I at least know how to read up on a concept as it relates to a business problem through academic sources like Intro to Statistical Learning. 

These are the steps I've already taken, but I frankly feel a little bit intimidated and at times wracked by self-doubt when I look at the steep learning path. Part of me speculates that I could re-engage with the field of human-machine interaction as a Change Management/Domain Expert that at least understands the principles of DS & ML.

Making it immune to outsourcing? As I [29M] join the workforce and will focus on having a family.,"I apologize in advance if anything I say is controversial. I'm genuinely curious about the future of this line of career and don't mean to offend anyone from any country.

I'm currently 29M, about to finish my PhD in a STEM field. A huge lesson I've learned, being involved in research, startups and big corporations is that programmers and coders are just a workforce, which can be bought, used and then put on the shelf. The availability of good programmers is growing every year, especially with most software tools being freely available and huge competition from programmers from developing countries such as India and China. Additionally, I can clearly see things headed towards automation of programming.  Expertise in a tool-set might lead to short-term job prospects, but one can easily be replaced/automated. I'm planning a career in medical data-science. The deep learning models I'm building now for my PhD won't be a novelty very soon as computers get more powerful and infrastructures are setup to perform standard machine learning and deep learning at the click of a button/ call of a function, instead of needing to develop them in Tensorflow/PyTorch/Caffe/Scikit-Learn/R. Platforms such as R, Weka etc are headed that way currently.

There's a few things I've figured which will be difficult to automate and requires domain expertise and good communication skills. I'd love any comments on the following ways to secure a good career for the next 10-15 years. This is pure speculation of course:

1. Data Engineer: Expertise in the pre-learning stage, involving data pre-processing, cleaning, feature building  and maintenance of the data pipeline. This requires domain knowledge and cannot easily be performed by a generic data-scientist. This seems to be the most technically challenging and interesting.
2. Data Analyst: Great communication skills to convince the stakeholders/managers using the information provided by the data scientist. This seems quite future-proof however, the job focus seems to shift more towards communication, relying on soft-skills with a good working knowledge of data science. Requires good understanding of statistics. But having seen my friends attend multiple meetings trying to explain the meaning of statistics to the managers, I'm not sure this one is for me. 
3. Manager: Managing a team of data engineers, scientists, analysts. One level removed from the analysts. Less involvement with technology and more with people management skills. Personally, this doesn't interest me. I can see the appeal of this position for others though.
4. Data Scientist: Feel like this is at most risk of being automated. The models being used can be put in a standard infrastructure for ensemble methods, making the process of creating models from scratch redundant. Hyper-customized models however, would still be in demand.
5. Multi-disciplinary Data Science Application Engineer: This has been the most interesting discovery. Use of machine learning/statistical/deep learning techniques to develop a model that can be used as part of another ecosystem. For example, using a well-trained NLP sentiment analyzer for prediction of body posture and using MoCap for validation. Essentially, combining multiple technologies for building a product, instead of pure data-science for reporting/business intelligence. My PhD has been along these lines so far.

Hope I'm thinking along the correct lines. Seeing the fast changing ecosystem of A.I./M.L./Data-science got me thinking about future career prospects as I enter the stage in my life to increase my focus on building a family and providing for them. Thus, limiting the amount of time I can dedicate to keeping on top of technologies/trends and require career stability. I'm extremely open to any suggestions/criticisms/corrections.

ei41fv,True,What are my options?,"Hi everyone, I am currently a business analyst at a large corporation and was considering moving in the direction of data. Throughout my career I have used a lot of SQL to pull data from our databases and VBA to automate reports. I had no formal education in programming though it has become a hobby of mine. I have learned on my own through the years through classes such as CS50 and Udemy courses to further my knowledge. I am no expert by any means but I understand programming concepts well and I have done small pet projects in my free time such as developing an android app.

The parts of my job that I enjoy the most are the SQL and VBA activities. I love putting together a VBA script that will automate something that would otherwise have taken a long time. I find the satisfaction of writing the script and seeing it work way more rewarding than anything else I have done in my career so far. It feels like I have built something that I know will be useful to someone else.

Recently I enrolled in Jose Portilla's udemy course on Data Science with Python. I am halfway through the course and feel that I am developing a very good understanding of the material. After enrolling in the course I began browsing this subreddit and it is rather discouraging. Recently I saw someone mention having a PHD and looking for an internship in data science. To me that screams enormous barrier of entry.. needing a PHD just for an internship? There is no way I can go back to school at the moment to get a PHD and I cannot afford too much of a pay cut as I am the sole provider for my family. It is disappointing because I was very much enjoying the content of Jose's class and was absorbing it rather naturally.

As of now I will continue the class to the end in the case that I learn something that I can use for a future analysis that no one else in my organization would know how to do. To them Python is magic.

Based on my post, does anyone have any advice for career pivots I can look into? As mentioned above I really enjoy writing scripts, automation, I enjoyed the Data Science that I was learning but the barrier of entry seems too high for where I am. I was thinking maybe I can continue learning Python and use it to become a BI Analyst or Test Automation engineer. I enjoy programming (though am not an expert) and writing scripts more than anything I have done in my career thus far. With that being said does anyone have any career advice?

eku0yn,True,Bernhard Schölkopf's group vs. a non-ML group at ETH Zurich for a Masters thesis.,"I have two MS thesis offers, both in core-ML topics.

One is at a non-ML group at ETH Zurich, though the PhD candidate who will be supervising it is very much a core-ML guy.

The other is at Max Planck Institute (MPI), in Schölkopf's group. The supervisor will be an associate prof. equivalent researcher in the group.

Some context - I'm doing my Masters in Germany and have to decide between a thesis at one of these two venues. I would like to try and at least submit (if not publish) a top-tier paper towards the end of the thesis. Both potential supervisors have an adequate track-record of publishing at ICML/NIPS/ICLR . After graduation I am interested in either good ML PhD programs or R&D positions at FAANG(-ish) companies. I would also not mind a more ML Engineer/ Data Scientist role in a product team as well at such companies (it all depends on what kind of offers I get after graduation, or if I even get any offers to begin with :P ).

The question - which thesis should I go with? I think it really comes down to ""prestige"" of ETH vs. quality research of MPI-IS. The very reason I am asking this question is because most (read all) fellow students I have talked to (although most don't have a focus in ML research) do not recommend MPI over ETH (no matter how good the research at MPI is). Of course such a question is irrelevant if I only want to pursue a PhD, but what concerns me is that employers will view it similarly.

I looked at it, saw 4.6 and 4.7 star averages and courses with interesting titles and syllabus so I decided to take it and try to power finish it, since I already have some experience.

So I finished first two courses and boy oh boy - what a disaster. It is well expected for this kind of cert to force you use ecosystem of the provider being that google, amazon, IBM or whoever. However, you would expect it to be a WORKING environment. Everything is so outdated in the course notes, software looks nothing like in instructions, some of it even got completely revamped. There are issues with account creation, 503 server response everywhere, loading times in scale of minutes and so on.

At first I thought it was me, my system or location issues, but then you open forums and see hundreds or thousands of complaints that reach back to beginning of 2019 or end of 2018 even. There are band-aid fixes that are sometimes provided, but something that worked 8 months ago doesn't work now since something changed again. All in all a terrible experience.

All of this is just technical problems that made me tell others about this. What I will leave here without much in-depth analysis is the actual quizes and assignments, which I would call at least questionable in the sense how much someone can learn from. Sometimes it feels like it is testing your ability to use IBMs way of doing things, not the actual underlying technology.

Although I saw all this in their second course, I investigated other courses in specialization since i thought this was kind of a non essential topic (using notebooks and other resources). They all follow similar pattern with lot of people feeling disappointed and wanting their money back. From that I decided to bail from it, and felt the need to share this. All of this is easily verifiable by going to said courses, and selecting reviews - then most helpful. Who knows how these courses got such high grade average.

The rest 20% has some elements of other technical subjects (i.e.) Embedded systems and so on.

I have also had a math course dealing with vectors, solving ODEs etc. 

So I have also been working parallely as a student at a relatively big organisation in Germany. The basic idea of the task that I have been assigned is to use Python to design scripts to work with live data and generate multiple observations from them. So my job would be to kind of take the data and put it through my script and get the requested observations from it. It can include generating scatter/bar/histogram plots ,or performing basic operations and segregating the data into different factors/levels. I mainly use pandas, numpy and matplotlib. I have to create the logic and basic algorithms for these scripts from scratch by myself and make a script out of it, so that my manager can import these scripts in his jupyter notebooks and run the data through it to get the observations he needs to do his analysis. I don't want to mention the length of my script as usually no of lines of code is a terrible way to measure complexity of the problem.

After doing extensive research I feel like my program had not emphasized math courses as much as I will only have Calculus 2 under my belt. I have been looking at different graduate schools and I'm looking at an MS in Computer Science. I wonder though if my program has lacked sufficient areas for a program like this I was wondering if anyone here has had a similar issue?

 I'm starting to think my Undergraduate degree in Data Science was a mistake and that I should've pursued a BS in either Computer Science or Statistics? 

Here are some examples of what I've taken 

CS Algorithms 1 and 2

CS Data Base Management

CS Machine Learning

DATA SCIENCE Unsupervised Learning

DATA SCIENCE Management Structured Data

DATA Science Other general Data science things

STATS Intermediate States

STATS Regression 

STATS Principle Study Design

STATS Experimental Design

By the time I will graduate I will have a Minor in Stats.

Otherwise I could pursue a MS in Stats or Data Science but I think I'm wrong if I pursue those areas since with Stats I would have to spend time taking the additional math before the more advance courses and I think the Data Science MS would just redoing things that my program already covered.

enoify,True,Is a softer master's from a prestigous University better than a harder master's from an average University?,"Brief background: I'm currently a behavioural data analyst at a big company in UK, have 3-4 years experience, did poorly on my undergrad (chemistry) due to medical reasons, doing a grad diploma in economics, now applying for Master's.

The question is, for the purposes of career advancement (ideally in the tech space), would a softer degree from a more prestigous university be preferable to a harder degree from a more average university. The 2 primary options are a course from Edinburgh called ""Data Science, Technology and Innovation"" which has some rigourous CS/Stats content but a lot broader/less depth with some sociology modules, or ""Applied Statistics""/""Data Science"" at Birkbeck, University of London. The stats course is very traditional and rigerous with little CS/ML content, and the DS course is a mixture of introductory CS and stats.

My current thinking is that any skill gap can be made up with self study considering the glut of great free content available for learning more advanced statistical/ML methods, and the purposes of the degree is (of course to advance knowledge but) primarily to open up new oppurtunities.

I understand that there are a multitude of posts regarding how to break into Data Science (DS) without a CS degree or PhD; however, I haven't seen one discussing what non-CS, non-PhD Data Scientist do once they're one in terms of career prospects. I hope this post will allow those type of people to share their experiences.

I’m a new age Product/Analytics Data Scientist (mix of Business Intelligence using SQL/Python/Tableau and using ML for impact analysis, but limited data engineering and no production-level ML). Having worked for several months, I have become keenly aware of several things about myself:

1. I lack the CS background required to become a Data Engineer (setting up data lakes from scratch; ETL automation; deploying a ML model to production);
2. I lack the PhD background and also do not enjoy the high-level mathematics that will be required to become a ML Engineer (building and optimising cutting-edge algorithms);
3. I lack the economics/finance background to become an DS Economist (focusing on econometrics).

In short, due to my background, I feel like I’m a half-baked DS who can only remain as a Product/Analyst DS, unless I put a ludicrous amount of time and effort to overcome my (MSc in structural engineering) background and specialise. Similarly, it’ll be very difficult for me to become a non-specialised “full-stack” DS which is highly sought in small-midscale startups. I’ve also been told that DS Managers who lack technical/specialised expertise are unable to climb far in the management career ladder (say Head of Data), which means just remaining in my current position will likely be a bad move in the long term.

For those that were in a similar situation, what did you end up doing and how did it work out? Did you grit your teeth and specialise, or did you end up switching careers? Please share your experiences!",royalon,402,398,1444060562.0,1587265998.923008

esdied,True,Should I pursue a data science master or choose another career path?," Hello fellow redditors, I've started lurking in relevant subreddits for my career, mostly /r/cscareerquestions and [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/). Today, I'd like to ask for your help.

My current situation: I'm a student from Germany and finished my bachelor's degree with a GPA of \~3.6 (1.4 in German grading system). I studied Business Informatics / Information Systems, which has like 1/3 computer science, 1/3 economics and 1/3 of information systems (think of business process modeling, knowledge management, development of application systems (waterfall model, scrum etc.)). Right now, I'm doing a gap year where I'm doing two internships (these are usually not done for job offers but for work experience) before I want to start my master's degree. Since I did two courses in data analytics, I started liking this topic a lot and also wrote my thesis about a data science topic where I analyzed a dataset in R.

Initially, I planned to do a data science master abroad but reading a lot about the career opportunities of data scientists on Reddit I'm not so sure anymore. I'm reading more and more that these programs are cash grabs and are created because of student demands, while there are actually not that many jobs for inexperienced data scientists.

While I had fun with statistics and aced these courses in university, I don't have a hardcore math/stats background and also not a CS background. I like the application and comprehension of models on a higher level but not really the maths stuff. But on Reddit, you basically read that this is absolutely essential as a data scientist and everybody recommends a statistics degree. So I'm also not sure if I should pursue this path. I also tried to pick up elements of statistical learning, which seems to be a must-read for aspiring data scientists, but I couldn't really get into it. It was too difficult for me.

Right now, I'm also thinking of just continuing my degree in Information Systems (I don't think there really is an equivalent in the US, at least I don't know of one) since I also really like most of the IT topics. For a project in my current internship, I'm designing the system architecture and the API specification and also develop a web application (frontend in Angular, backend in node.js). At another internship, I was part of a data warehouse project where we were the link between software development and the business, basically translating the business requirements to the developers and assure that it's implemented correctly. This meant creating test data and validating correct ETL processes. 

Most Information Systems master degrees also offer some data analytics courses. The ones I took at my university were also from the master's program. My second internship will also be at a data science consultancy where I will code in R most of the day.

What would you do in my situation? I really like to work with data but this career path seems kind of ""insecure"" compared to being more generalistic in IT.",beld78,85,180,1387125374.0,1587265998.923008

esj9a0,True,(Need help deciding) Self-learning Data Science/Machine Learning vs going to UCB(Berkeley) for Master's in Data Science($90k),"Hi all,  
I'm kind of stumped right now and need some insight into helping me make a major decision in shaping my career future in Data Science.

Just a little background of myself before I start. 

* Based in Canada 
* Have 2 years of being a Data Analyst under my belt
*  Have completed a Business degree at UBC with a GPA of 3.7/4.0
* Have a bit of knowledge in coding specifically in Java and Dr Racket (I've done a few uni courses on these areas). Not familiar with Python or R.- Have good knowledge in SQL, have a year of experience using it in work as well as learning it through a uni course
*  Have 2 years of work experience using Data Visualization tools, Power BI & Tableau
*  Have only the foundational knowledge in Stats. Just Stats I & II. No knowledge in Linear Algebra.

My goal:

*  Get into a data science(preferred)/data analyst position in FANG(Google etc) in the U.S. in the quickest way possible.

To start, I'm not sure if I should shed USD 90k on a master's degree in data science from Berkeley or should I just self-learn data science tools and Machine learning?

TLDR on the reasons why I'm choosing Berkeley over other programs is:

* It's online/remote. I can work while taking it
* It's from a prestigious school. This matters to me.
*  I'm genuinely interested in Data Science/Machine Learning.
*  I don't want to waste my undergrad GPA.
* The majority of the people who work at Google, for instance, are from Stanford and Berekely

  
My questions for you

1. 1. Do you think with the 2 years as a Data Analyst be enough to qualify me for interviews for Data Science positions if I also self-learned the material myself?
2.  Should I be spending USD 90k for a master's in data science?
3.  Do you think having a Master's in Data Science from Berkeley will help put me in a better position in applying for Data Science positions?
4.  What are your thoughts?
5.  What was your path to becoming a Data Scientist like?",emersonwoodz,136,25,1412443654.0,1587265998.923008

I am a data scientist at tech startup. I am a member of this subreddit on my regular account, but I am using an anonymous account for obvious reasons.

My small company right now is pitching to investors to raise another round of capital. Today the chief of staff asked me to make histogram plots from our database that they are using to pitch to investors.

The problem is that these histogram plots are being used to make a pitch to investors that I know is factually not statistically certain or correct or academically honest at all.

I made this clear to the CEO, the data science manager, and the chief of staff, and presented an alternative (and real) story about how we use our data - they all turned it down, saying the real story is too complex. The chief of staff straight up said that how they message with investors doesn't have to reflect how we are using our data in real life to maintain our informational advantage in the marketplace.

**Was I asked to defraud investors? Or am I just freaking out?**

**Is it normal to knowingly claim statistical significance from data when none exists as a way to raise money from investors?**

Now apart from maybe specializing in a more quantitative finance based courses or business analytics based courses, what can I do to put me on the right path to work as a data analyst and maybe scientist? 

Now No, I do **not** want to switch out of finance as I am able to maintain a good GPA above a 3.7 here and if I switch to something not only will it make my time in university longer which I cannot afford both literally and figuratively, I don't want to switch to something too abstract that may hurt my grades due to a lack of aptitudes plus I have seen many on this Reddit come from a finance background. If it's needed economics or business technology management (basically a more advanced MIS program) is the only place I'll budge towards.

So:

What is a good first programming language to learn for Data? Python I'd assume with SQL?

What are some good projects I could do to help cater my expertise to a more analytical/data-based side?

Coursera or Udemy for learning Data Science/Analyst material?

Is Tableau/Microsoft Database necessary?

eyfffv,True,Questions from an intern,"I'm graduating this spring with a degree in Mathematics from a strong university, have volunteer experience as a data analyst, and am currently a paid ""Data Science Intern"". I have participated in ds hackathons and have done small personal projects that I don't post anywhere since I still consider them all wips. I plan on graduate school after spending a year or two in industry, but currently I'm not sure what the ""industry"" really looks like. I have also been sending out a lot of apps getting little traction, although most of my applications are to large tech companies.

Right now, I'm getting my first tastes of distributed computing by learning metaflow and will soon be learning about cloud computing with aws and gcp since we're working on a larger model. I currently do all of my work on smaller datasets (<15 gb) locally on my work's machine. My workflow is typically just importing from a db in rmarkdown or jupyter notebook, cleaning, eda, modeling, then writing executive summaries and creating graphics. Nothing gets deployed anywhere.

However, my supervisor and coworkers don't provide feedback on any of my projects and although I'm learning a ton (topics like NLP), I feel that I don't have a strong grasp of my weaknesses and where I could improve. I've mentioned this to my supervisor with no change. 

Given this background, my questions are the following:

\- How did you apply to your current job? (LinkedIn, from their website, etc.)

\- When applying for jobs, was it really *that* important to post your projects and have a strong github profile? What do you think attributed to you actually getting an interview/ getting hired?

\- Is my process similar to what any of you working in the industry do? What else do you do?

\- What were tools that helped you better prepare for your careers? What are you currently learning about?",Petersaurous,1087,4249,1338755761.0,1587265998.923008

However, I know next to nothing about NLP, parallel computing, deep learning, classes/structs/general OOP, no languages beyond R and very basic python, data structures, SQL, hadoop, git, data pipelines, computer vision and unstructured data.

Background:

I  am currently doing my first semester at Stellenbosch University in  South Africa. I love Austria (and Switzerland/Germany too) and my dream  would be to live there one day. So, with the eventual goal of  immigration in mind, I have to pick between two options. I aim on  working in the financial sector, but with a strong data science/machine  learning approach to topics such as business analytics and financial  management.

The **first**  being continuing my degree at Stellenbosch and then aiming to do a  Masters in Austria. I have no idea how difficult or easy it is, I always  met by an ""it depends"". I do however, think it might be possible.  However, it might be easier with a degree from Austria (although I'm not  sure). Benefits are it's convenient. That is debatable more in line  with what I want to do (more finance modules). It's secure, I don't have  to worry about depression etc. I have a good social network and it's  really ""fun"" to live here. Just dangerous and frustrating.

The **second**  option, is studying Artificial Intelligence at the JKU. I am leaning  more on this side for some rational, but also some subjective reasons.  The rational reasons being that successfully completing this degree  allows me to emigrate to Austria and live there (if I can find a job -  which I think should not be a problem) without even having to do a  Masters. Then secondly, although a might be wrong, I think it would be  easier to carry on with my Masters in Austria after having done my  undergrad there (perhaps even at the same university). Thirdly, I might  have a better standing in the job market having lived in Austria for so  long and having my undergrad from Austria. I can, after my BSc in AI,  continue on to do something like a CFA or a MA in Banking at Finance at  Uni Wien.

Officially, my math game is weak. In undergrad I did receive As for all my STEM courses, but I only took linear algebra and discrete structures/probability/game theory. I did really well in those, but I never took calc or statistics, because I didn’t need to for my major.

I took the GRE a couple years ago and got a very high verbal score, but only a 151 on the quantitative portion. I know objectively that I’m good at math when I apply myself, since it’s integral to my humanities research, but I don’t really know how to prove it. All of my academic awards, teaching experience, funding etc has been for rhetoric and writing.

Do I have any chance of getting into data science or statistics MS programs next year with no paper trail of a math/programming background? I want to learn more, and I’m really passionate about this field. I just don’t have the breadth to start over completely and get a BS in math or something.

f5tjj0,True,Student who needs advice for how to proceed with education...,"I am really stuck. I've been working for a year now to take all the courses I would need to apply to a new Data Science M.S degree at my local college, but I've begun to question whether it will be a good idea because the professors in this department DON'T WANT TO TEACH. They act like they are throwing us a bone whenever they give out information and assign homework like it's a challenge to prove that we should be here. The whole university has an inferiority complex due to some local history, and both me and my husband, who is a software developer and has been there to help me throughout this process, have been gobsmacked at how hostile the professors can be towards the student population. A good recent example was when I went to one of my professors to ask questions about a homework assignment and, instead of patiently answering them, he scoffed and said each one should have been ""obvious"". And he isn't unique. I've also had professors who were helpful, but the problem was they had to be because they did such a poor job explaining in class. Despite this, I've done well in all my classes, but it's been stressful to teach myself what I need to know over and over again. 

My other option is a bootcamp through a different local university, but I initially dismissed it as an option because it costs the same as the Master's. However, in light of the time it would take to complete this masters and how unprofessional I am finding their faculty, I am wondering whether it will be worth it. What is the point of having a more prestigious set of letters after my name if I would have to kill myself just to get through it? If I could have been equally confused reading the textbook on my own, why am I paying them? I would really appreciate guidance on what would best help me get into data analytics. I love this field and want to excel. Thank you. 

Also, I want to add I already have a master's in an unrelated field and professional experience under my belt, and in both cases I had great mentors and know what that should look like. Just wanted to communicate I am not being shocked with a higher standard. My first 2 degrees were through good universities. Thanks.",cmurphgarv,10288,4131,1527858350.0,1587265998.923008

f6c02f,True,Breaking in as an accountant?,"Hey guys,

I’m an accountant of two years and I decidedly hate what I do and want to pivot into a more analytical role, and am just seeking some input. I went into accounting because I ENJOY working with data. I was always fascinated with baseball statistics growing up and knew I wanted to do something with spreadsheets and numbers. When I went to school, I was accepted into the business school and was pushed towards accounting, as I was a naive 18 year old who knew that accounting involved spreadsheets but that was about it.

My question is - how possible - if at all, is it to get into data science with a background in accounting, assuming I don’t have the time or money to invest in another degree right now.

I have spent the past few months teaching myself SQL queries and database concepts on YouTube and KhanAcademy in my free time and really enjoy it. I want to find a role where I can use these. I also have experience with Access, Tableau/PowerBi, and Salesforce from projects at school, but have not been exposed to these in a professional setting.

I know the next step is to learn how to add Pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to my skillset but I am hoping I can find an entry level role before then, as I can tell it’s going to take me significant time to learn these.

I am a 3rd year philosophy undergrad. I love the content but at this point I can clearly see the misery that waits for me if I go into PhD in Philosphy.  So,  as electives I have taken Statistics, Data Analysis, Linear Algebra, Calculus, C programming. I hope to take R programming and Complex analysis before I finish the school.  We don't have official minor programs with Math and CS, so I have to try to take whatever I can individually.

I'm also self teaching but I know that's irrelevant.

I'm in a very competetive environment and it's very hard for me to get a DS internship,( or any other white collar internship) and I really want to do a masters. DS masters accept only from technical backgrounds but I still wanted to ask if there are any DS  programs that I can get into with my modest elective coursework, or more data-related hybrid  humanities programs that dont require technical background.

Otherwise I have to consider going for masters in economics, which is easier for me to get in but much harder regarding content.

f6pnmc,False,Why Some Companies Want Their Data Scientists to be Good Engineers,"There have been several posts lately about the apparently growing trend for data scientist jobs to have engineering requirements. Most of the explanations are some combination of:

* assuming job description does not match actual role
* different job types being lumped into ""data scientist"" title
* assuming companies don't know what they're doing or doing things ""wrong""

Those things are probably happening to some degree. But there some very valid reasons for companies to want people who marry data scientist and engineer skills, which I don't really see being given much coverage in these discussions, so I would like to cover some of them.

Even if you disagree with the reasons, you should be aware that these positions are lucrative, and in my opinion, do interesting work, so it might make sense to understand what these positions are and why they have the requirements they do.

A growing number of companies have products which rely on making recommendations or decisions at scale and rely on ML to make those decisions. It's a critical business need for the systems to be robust. However, experimentation and iteration are key components of data science, so systems must also be adaptable. I hope it's obvious that building a robust, yet adaptable system is a hard engineering challenge.

You might wonder why it is the realm of data scientists and not of data engineers and machine learning engineers to work on such a system. The answer is it is the realm of all three. Data engineers and machine learning engineers will own certain core components and data scientists will own certain modules.

An example might be that the data engineering team owns a system that performs ETL, but a data scientist might implement a transformation to calculate a specific feature or metric that is then run within the ETL system to produce the feature on a regular basis. If the data scientist is owning the actual transform, then she likely takes into account computational complexity when designing the feature, has verified the code produces the expected output, and is not blocked by another team's planning / priorities.

Another example is that as decision making systems evolve, their complexities grow. A simple system might use an ML model and make some decision based on a threshold, i.e. choose a point on the ROC. I'm not sure this case is very common in practice. More complex systems have multiple available actions and rely on the outputs of multiple models. Evolutions of these systems might come from increasing the size of the action space or increasing the number of different models in use. It is usually data scientists who are proposing, designing, and testing these evolutions. Designs to be cognizant of engineering challenges - it is very wasteful to design and build something that cannot be used in practice. On the other hand, it is very difficult for engineers to build something they do not understand.

Even something as simple as training a model cannot be divorced from engineering realities. Large scale systems have latency and memory constraints. The freedom that is present during model explorations to include new features or try new model architecture is generally at odds with these constraints. New ideas that cannot be implemented in the production system are wasted, so data scientists have to have a strong understanding of how those constraints affect their models.

So if I were to try to list the key arguments I would probably go with:

* Coordination costs between teams are very high, so enabling data scientists to put their work directly into production makes iteration a lot faster
* Incorporating an understanding of production constraints into the design of new ideas means that execution will be much smoother
* Keeping context of the details of the production system allows the data scientist to make more accurate assessments of what changes will have the highest impact

Which data science paradigm is right for a given company clearly depends on a number of factors, including company size, the extent to which ML is critical to the business, variety of ML products within the company, etc. My impression is that, at least in the tech industry, the data scientist with engineering expertise paradigm is taking hold across a pretty large range of company sizes, with only the very large and very small sticking with the data scientists who are doing very little engineering work.",mhwalker,2021,1512,1278020262.0,1587265998.923008

Most of my math electives revolved around statistical inference, probability, and discrete math. Took electives in business too (accounting, finance, econ). Graduated in May 2019.

**My current role and experience**: Started as a Spring Intern 2019, Summer Intern 2019, then  joined full-time in August as a ""Jr. Business Analyst."" in the Corporate Finance/FP&A division. Previous intern experience in finance (fixed income research). I am located in NYC, FWIW.

**My responsibilities:**  are more on the analytics/visualization/reporting side of things. I use R, Python and SQL to create ad-hoc analyses or for automating processes. Additionally, I am the only report developer in my division maintaining our Power BI app, so I spend a lot of time coming up with DAX as well. We have a Power BI team for the company as a whole, involving Sales, Ops, and the Database Architects, and I solely represent the Finance division, while also helping other teams with their own Power BI projects.

The most ""Data Science"" project I'll be working on is developing a forecasting model for sales--looking to use time series/regression analysis for that one, then eventually it will become more complex as need be.

I am starting to dislike dashboarding and being closely involved with the business. Dashboarding is starting to feel like monkey work and working with non-technical people, (technologically illiterate) is frustrating because they don't really know what they want, or ask for something that isn't feasible. I am seeking to be in a role that's more research oriented, or focused exclusively in programming/statistics (model building, validation, etc.).

It's nice to be recognized by key stakeholders in the business, but I would prefer to be in a more technical role, which is more stimulating--also looking for somewhat of a mentor. My superiors all come from business backgrounds. Additionally, I am being severely underpaid for my work (60% below market rate). There are ""Business Intelligence Analysts"" in other divisions who can't do half of what I do, or even possess my skillset (they are just Power BI and Excel monkeys), but have a nicer title and are paid more than me.

Any advice to get out of BI and into a true data science role? Will start shopping around and testing the job market when my 1 year mark in my current role passes.

I'm refreshing my knowledge in calc, linear algebra, probability theory, and statistical inference. In addition, I'm becoming more familiar with the popular Python libraries for DS (sci-kit learn, Keras, TensorFlow), learning from the *Hands on Machine Learning* book.

f9ihzy,True,Please critique my resume,"Hello all,

I have been seeing a job developer for the past few months along with an employment counselor. I've had my resume critiqued so much and I feel like I am getting less responses. Currently I have my resume at 2 pages but I think maybe I should get it down to one so would like to know what structure would be best.

I am looking for an entry level role in data science or analytics. My goal is to get a full time job and pursue an online masters part-time. I went back to school as a mature student so all of my previous work experience is not relevant as I used to be in administration, customer services, factories, and warehouses. 

I graduated in end of 2017 but had no luck in terms of finding my first entry level DS/DA job in my first year of searching. I decided to volunteer so now most of my experience is volunteer. I took a couple of jobs working in the elections but they were only for 1 day. I am thinking of removing them from my resume.

My job developer suggested maybe I need to use a functional resume because I don't have paid experience and have just volunteer.

Also I had a Summary of Qualifications and that was where I listed my soft/tech skills. Now I just have a summary and a section outlining my tech skills. I am not sure if this later method is better because I think I'm getting less interviews and we all know resumes are for getting the interview.

I've anonymized my resume for the most part (well except for the university I went to.

These are areas I think I need to improve: 

1. education (is it too long? I want to capture my knowledge in both math and computer programming)
2. length: I want it down to 1 page but how? do I post that I worked elections? what about hackathons?
3. summary & tech skills vs summary of qualifications. How to summarize my skills i.e. how to categorize, label.
4. should I just list the places I have volunteered at without a description?
5. In my header, I say ""email: [me@me.com](mailto:me@me.com)"". should I just say [""me@me.com](mailto:""me@me.com)"" and not preface everything by what it is?

I'm really frustrated with my job search as I think I previously wrote a post on how I took a break as the rejection got to me. I know I have the skill set and I am an excellent employee. I am female and sometimes I wonder if that's been a factor. Also I have been looking on this subredit for resume critiques and saw that Novoresume was suggested. Do people suggest I use that? I still need to make sure I have the right content.

Anyways, I'd appreciate people who have had some experience hiring or have found their resume generated a lot of responses. Thanks for your comments!

f9y4fd,False,PhD hunger at medium/low-tier companies,"I'm noticing a trend that I wanted to put out there and get some feedback.

**Background**

I'm a graduate student (not CS or stats) on my last semester, looking for my first full-time position. I was offered a full time DS role at SAP in Palo Alto. My fiance really, really wanted to stay in Chicago. And due to a list of financial reasons, I declined the role. Nonetheless, getting offered the role put some serious wind in my sails.

Well, things are not quite the same in Chicago. Many applications get the automated ""we've moved on to other candidate emails"", other times I make it so the final interview. Nonetheless, several companies far less appealing than SAP have not extended an offer.

**So here's the trend I'm noticing**

In cities like Chicago, the requirements are often ""MS in stats or CS required, PhD in either field heavily preferred."" Yet, in cities like Palo Alto or San Francisco, the explicit requirements are often less stringent, like ""high proficiency with statistics and machine learning accrued through academic of professional experiences."" in fact, this was the language used by SAP.

**My hypothesis**

Companies like SAP, and those more prestigious in the tech world (ie FAANG), *know how to teach the skills they need.* It's okay if you don't have a PhD in CS, they know how to train you. Ultimately, they want to see that you possess *the right mindset to absorb complex material quickly*.

Conversely, I believe most companies in Chicago don't know how data science fits into their organization. They know that they need to spend minimum 80k/yr to staff an entry level role and they can't afford to waste that on the wrong talent. Plus with the population so high and several great universities like (U Chicago and Northwestern) they're able to ask and reasonably expect to catch some PhD level applicants.

Consider this - Google has released ML products like word2vec, BERT, etc. Just in NLP, they're a dominant force. Yet companies that are light years behind from Google seem to think that they'd know how to fully utilize a PhD if they had one. I'd like to laugh, but I'm really just discouraged. My hat's off to self taught DS. You definitely have to prove your worth to lock down a DS role and deserve accolades for doing it.

I am and employee of Northwestern University. I received a bachelors in neuroscience and then came to Northwestern for a research tech position.

I have heard both ends of the spectrum of ""this changed my life and I got a great job out of it"" to ""this was a total waste of time and money and I am so glad it's over.""

I feel there's a discrepancy between (1) what people ***think*** makes them good candidates for data science / engineering roles vs. (2) what ***actually*** makes them good candidates for data science / engineering roles.

1. **What some people** ***think*** **makes them good candidates for data roles at a company:** master's degree in data science; Kaggle projects; worked through a reading list; taken online courses in data science.
2. **What** ***actually*** **makes people good candidates for data roles at a company:** collected and analysed data for fun; worked with data at a company before; worked with data in a research role in a university.

How do these differ, in practice? The second group of people know that data is messy; they're motivated to work with data; they've used real-world tools; they seem more ""interesting""; they have hard-won critical thinking and communication skills.  All of these things are important in data science.

Implications: If you want to break into the area of data science, and you don't have much experience, work on a real project that requires you to collect, analyse, and present real data.

I'd say I have a passible understanding of Fortran and C++ from my research, and a decent understanding of Python from my current job. I understand that those skills probably not what would be in demand, but I find that picking up other languages gets easier the more I get exposed to, and more importantly the process behind programming is quite attractive to me.

I'm adding an edit to hopefully give a summary for myself and anyone else who stumbles along this post. I'll try to make the results more applicable too given that not everyone has a PhD.

People seem to indicate that there are various paths one could take as a data scientist to transition into a more CS position:

* **Backend developer** **-** would basically entail a clean break from data science in essence; take that as you will. Working with web systems and databases most likely. 
* **DE/MLE -** staying in the ""Data Science Field""**^(TM)**, just moving away from the analysis and into more of the guts of the infrastructure/algorithm deployment. Think big data management or taking your crappy Jupyter notebook and turning into a deployable code framework, optimizing, etc.
* **Quant -** probably the hardest transition, usually reserved for people with post-graduate degrees in a highly technical field. Applying statistical models to the financial sector, predicting what to buy/sell, etc. ",doctor_of_space,104,1757,1572877363.0,1587265998.923008

fgusho,False,What is the closest Python equivalent of R's dbplyr?,"Most people who use R for data science are familiar with its [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package. [Dbplyr](https://db.rstudio.com/dplyr/) allows users to work with remote data stored in databases as if it was in-memory data. Basically, it translates dplyr verbs into SQL queries. Crucially, it has two enormous advantages over simply sending out SQL queries through a connection:

&#x200B;

>The most important difference between ordinary data frames and remote database queries is that your R code is translated into SQL and executed in the database, not in R. When working with databases, dplyr tries to be as lazy as possible:

>It never pulls data into R unless you explicitly ask for it.  
>  
>It delays doing any work until the last possible moment: it collects together everything you want to do and then sends it to the database in one step.

I'm looking for a similar package for Python. So far, I've found two packages which do something akin to the ""verb-to-SQL"" translation of dbplyr: [Blaze](https://github.com/blaze/blaze) and [Ibis](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis) (I've actually found them through [this r/datascience post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7w0ap8/the_dplyr_r_package_has_an_explain_function_that/)).

I haven't yet been able to figure out if they offer the same ""laziness"" of dbplyr, so if anyone could clear that out for me, it would be greatly appreciated. Between Blaze and Ibis, which one would you recommend?

I was accepted to and am debating between the following programs:

   * In-state tuition (\~20k), done in one year
* Vanderbilt University's PhD in Civil Engineering
   * Funded 5 years (31k each year, tuition waived)
   * Mentor does research in transportation/environmental data analytics

&#x200B;

For those of you already out there in industry, what difference in opportunity do you see between Masters and PhD graduates?

My initial thoughts on the two programs: Despite being unfunded, NCSU has valuable industry ties that correlate with excellent job placement and salary expectations. On the flip side of the coin, I see lots of advice to take funded grad programs when they're available. Vandy has an excellent reputation and earning a doctorate may open doors to leadership positions down the line.  If I decide research isn't right for me, I would still be able to leave at the 2 year mark with a funded masters degree.

For context, my career goals are to use data science to help with public environmental issues, from climate change to natural disaster relief.

Mathematical Foundations

These courses are intended to help lay the foundation for learning more advanced maths, as well as foster the development of mathematical thinking. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Introduction to Logic, Stanford (course)
This course is an introduction to Logic from a computational perspective. It shows how to encode information in the form of logical sentences; it shows how to reason with information in this form; and it provides an overview of logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.

Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, Stanford (course)
Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.

High School Mathematics, MIT (collection of courses)
In this section we have provided a collection of mathematics courses and resources from across MIT. Some are materials that were used to teach MIT undergraduates, while others were designed specifically for high school students.

The course emphasises the key ideas and historical motivation for calculus, while at the same time striking a balance between theory and application, leading to a mastery of key threshold concepts in foundational mathematics.

 
Statistics & Probability

Statistics and probability are the foundations of data science, more so than any other family of mathematical concepts. These courses will help prepare you to look at data through the statistical lens and with a critical probabilistic eye. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Statistics and probability, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers analyzing categorical data, displaying and comparing quantitative data, summarizing quantitative data, modeling data distributions, exploring bivariate numerical data, study design, probability, counting, permutations, and combinations, random variables, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, significance tests, two-sample inference for the difference between groups, inference for categorical data, advanced regression, analysis of variance

Fundamentals of Statistics, MIT (course)
Statistics is the science of turning data into insights and ultimately decisions. Behind recent advances in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence are fundamental statistical principles. The purpose of this class is to develop and understand these core ideas on firm mathematical grounds starting from the construction of estimators and tests, as well as an analysis of their asymptotic performance

Data Science: Probability, Harvard (course)
We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing is likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance.

Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data, MIT (course)
The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including: multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions, laws of large numbers, the main tools of Bayesian inference methods, an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)

Improving your statistical inferences, Eindhoven University of Technology (course)
First, we will discuss how to correctly interpret p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes Factors, and likelihood ratios, and how these statistics answer different questions you might be interested in. Then, you will learn how to design experiments where the false positive rate is controlled, and how to decide upon the sample size for your study, for example in order to achieve high statistical power. Subsequently, you will learn how to interpret evidence in the scientific literature given widespread publication bias, for example by learning about p-curve analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy of science, theory construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication studies, why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following Open Science principles.

Introduction to Probability and Data, Duke University (course)
This course introduces you to sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory and Bayes' rule. You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization.

Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics, Penn State (course)
Courseware for a pair of related courses covers introduction to probability, discrete distributions, continuous distributions, bivariate distributions, ditributions of functions of random variables, estimation, hypothesis testing, nonparametric methods, bayesian methods, and more.

 
Mathematics for Data Science & Machine Learning

These are mathematics topics directly related to data science and machine learning. They may include material from courses above, and may also be more elementary than some of above as well. However, they can be useful for brushing up on material you may not have studied in a while, and which is especially pertinent to the practice of data science. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Data Science Math Skills, Duke University (course)
Data science courses contain math—no avoiding that! This course is designed to teach learners the basic math you will need in order to be successful in almost any data science math course and was created for learners who have basic math skills but may not have taken algebra or pre-calculus. Data Science Math Skills introduces the core math that data science is built upon, with no extra complexity, introducing unfamiliar ideas and math symbols one-at-a-time.

Essential Math for Machine Learning: Python Edition, Microsoft (course)
This course is not a full math curriculum; it's not designed to replace school or college math education. Instead, it focuses on the key mathematical concepts that you'll encounter in studies of machine learning. It is designed to fill the gaps for students who missed these key concepts as part of their formal education, or who need to refresh their memories after a long break from studying math.

Mathematics for Machine Learning, Imperial College London (specialization)
For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it’s used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.",ComfortableHead3,1027,1730,1581709593.0,1587265998.923008

So over a couple of years I’ve been interested in data science but never took anything to learn it. Quite frankly I was waiting for some courses near me but nothing popped up.

I understand the fundamental differences between data science (mathematical models, analyzing data, predictions etc) and more traditional software engineering. Both sound interesting, and I'm not really sure which one of these I want to be working with in my future career.

I'm not really sure how to build and structure my education plan. The math minor will definitely help me on either ""path""/area. What is the general consensus: is it easier to self-study software engineering principles later on and get a related job that way, or is focusing on that in uni and later on self-studying data science and stats principles easier? My initial guess is that it would be better for me to take the data science + math combo in uni and later on learn about swe/developer ""stuff"", but maybe I'm wrong here?  


The ""traditional CS"" curriculum is more SWE-focused, with software projects and related theory, while the data science curriculum contains more stats and ""data courses"".

So I have a bit of an eclectic academic history which has been fun for the most part, but a lack of focus has finally caught up with me and my options to remain in academia is now somewhat lacking - enter the idea of a Data Science career?

Basic history:

MEng in Electrical Engineer, PhD in Applied Physics (Particle Accelerators), Postdoc in Scientific Software Development (you see the problem?)

Computing skills:C++, Python, C, Java, MATLAB, Mathematica, R, Git, GitHub, Excel/Sheets, Linux-based systems

No real SQL/Hadoop experience unfortunately.

As far as statistics goes, I consider myself competent but never really been involved in a project which was stat heavy.

Same goes for machine learning, even done the Stanford Coursera course a while back because I was interested, but never really worked on a project involving ML.

How are employers with regard to taking into account online courses? Could I do a reasonable online Data Science qualification like the coursera IBM one to brush up on SQL etc and actually have a chance at transitioning or has that ship sailed now that people are graduating with Data Science degrees these days?

fpcltw,False,Data Scientists are just glorified analysts (and why Research Scientist is the new Data Scientist),"Data Scientist here in a mid-sized company in Bay Area tech. After working in this industry for few years, the fact that Data Scientist in no longer a true Data Scientist position is the only natural conclusion I can come up with. There are obviously those in companies, reputable or not, who get to do and productionize complex modeling solutions (especially if you have a PhD), but the overall trend is that most ""Data Scientists"" without PhDs in big companies have become SQL monkeys who don't even get to do something as simple as A/B testing. This is like if front-end web developers were rebranded as software engineers.

I mean it's even public knowledge too:  Lyft publicly stated how they rebranded the titles from analyst to scientist and data scientist to research scientist. This was  just to compete with other tech companies for talent that want the ""scientist"" in their title. [https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c](https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c). I was told by a buddy in FANG that Facebook is the one that started this trend.

How did this happen and what's the consequence? I don't know the precise origin, but I know that today what's driving this movement is the huge rush new grads with ""data science"" degrees, or perhaps waves of career changers from bootcamps who also want to find their gold.

What's the consequence? I think the consequence is that we all suffer from the rebranding, especially in terms of career development. First of all, it cheapens the name for everyone who holds this title. Second, those who have been doing true Data Science work (not just SQL all day for metrics tracking) will have to shift expectations and titles in order to preserve what they already have. Third, being stuck on menial tasks that don't impact business bottom line will make the job more expendable, meaningly highly susceptible to layoffs far more than those that are in the front lines of business/product impact. Fourth, this means lack of promotion and career development, since those who do get those have proven impact on business.

Yes, I have become jaded and pessimistic about the Data Science world in the Bay, especially not having a PhD myself that limits me from pursuing Research Scientists positions...

**EDIT:** It's quite funny that half of agree with me and half of you disagree vehemently. I actually want to be proven wrong in this case. But I'm nonetheless surprised that people couldn't care less about the HR who are cheapening the name of a scientist to make their job search easier and directing all their criticism toward a fellow Data Scientist just for pointing this situation out.

Also, yes, titles might not matter for you individually, but not having a clear breakdown of the work expectations in an organizational and institutional level is not a sign of progress. You wouldn't make this claim on the murky division is labor on government or hospital jobs for instance, or any positions of authority in public/private space.

Finally, Science as a title infers hypothesis, testing, validation through formulaic rules (mathematic or otherwise), etc. Yea sure at the end of the day, titles are just semantics, but the other extreme end of that is saying that ""well what's the problem of giving a someone who munges chemistry data the title of a ""Chemical Scientist""? Hell let's call anyone who deals with legal data a Lawyer. What this shows it that titles do matter to some degree, because it infers authority over a particular subject and the technical know-how.

I seek advice regarding the following: 

  
A. I can invest this out-of-work time to develop my current work skills:   

- Python: improve from intermediate+ (design and write better OOP, develop a more software dev style of coding)   

- Statistics: Still using out of college knowledge, can get more developed at abstraction, intuition, and baking in more stats in my general intuition (that comes with time and practice but I feel I can learn more on this end)   

- Cloud Dev (aka) MLOps: I've been some work on that end, seems very interesting to me as I come from an engineering background


B. Pick up a completely new skill: Deep Learning: 
I know just enough from school to say I trained a Neural Network, I'm not familiar with the details, the Keras/PyTorch feud nor advanced hyperparameter tunning. Either I can invest in the famous Coursera DL bundle, or Udacity or whichever fits.

* Case fatality rate is 2.5%
* There are 100 new deaths reported today

* We know, that the people who died today have been infected about 12 days ago. Since 2.5% of infected people die, we can now calculate the number of people who were newly infected 12 days ago with n=100/0.025 = 4000
* We know, that the number of infections doubles every 3 days. Therefore, the number of newly infected people today has to equate, all things being equal, 2^((12 / 3)) = 16 times the amount of 12 days ago. Thus, we can assume that, today 16\*4000=64000 people will be infected
* We can run this calculation for every date, resulting in a timeseries of (new)infections
* We can take the cumulative sum of that timeseries to retrieve the final timeseries of cumulative total estimated infections

&#x200B;

I created a little tool using streamlit to visualize the timeseries and play around with the assumptions for different countries:

fsif1v,False,Seeking Feedback on Data Science Workflow Tool,"I'm excited (and nervous) to share a product I've been working on for the past few months to get feedback from this community. While I'm more of a *heavy* lurker, /r/datascience has always been an excellent source of discovery and insights for Data Scientists both new and experienced.

I've seen a lot of frustrations when it comes to making Data Science effective in an organization. Issues like:

- Complicated tooling and configurations
- Lack of pipeline and data testing
- Lack of visibility into projects as they start to expand in complexity
- Being forced to wear hats for every step of the end-to-end data cycle
- Different data teams operating in silos
- Lack of access to required cloud resources
- Projects rarely making it to production

All of these issues make it difficult for a Data Science team to drive value and build trust. But I don't think it should have to be that way.

With these frustrations in mind, I set out to build a workflow platform - [Shipyard](https://www.shipyardapp.com) - that helps eliminate the friction of getting solutions to production so Data Scientists can focus more on Data, not DevOps.

To be brief, we've designed the platform to:

- Launch solutions with no DevOps or complicated setups involved. We're cloud-native and handle all scaling on your behalf.
- Orchestrate solutions across teams to create complex pipelines with no edits or additions to your code.
- Monitor and alert on the status of hundreds of solutions for peace of mind.
- Share custom, repeatable solutions with the larger organization using Blueprints.

We're still in the early stages, so I'm looking for anyone that might be interested in testing us out and providing feedback. It's 100% free right now in exchange for your feedback. If you're interested, let me know.

Either way, I'd love to hear the tools currently being used to manage workflows/pipelines and any problems you may be facing with them right now.",BlakeBurch,420,466,1298231616.0,1587265998.923008

fsu68c,True,Advice for big career change,"Hey everyone

As you can tell from the title I am looking for some advice and reassurances that I am on the right track to undergo a pretty big career change.

I currently work on DoD contracts for ISR (Drones) and am looking to get out of this line of work so I can actually be home and present with my family (mainly work in shit hole middle east). I have already accepted a masive pay cut to work for a small company back home as a ""software developer"" even though the job isn't really software development, it's just managing and making changes to tools that exist in MS Access / Excel using SQL or VBA for the Navy.

My education as it stands:

BaaS in Organizational Leadership through A&M

MS in Buisness Analytics (data analytics) (ongoing) through A&M

and I plan to chip away at a AAS in Computer Science while finishng my MS. program found here:  [http://catalog.midland.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=8&poid=1100](http://catalog.midland.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=8&poid=1100) 

Over the last few years I've been working ISR Assessments (one area of the overall ISR SME job). I've always found massive interest in this area than the others due to how data heavy it is. I love finding ways to improve data capturing processes with our outdated Microsoft Office tool suite. I've spent the last few years managing MS Access DBs, creating automated products in MS Excel, etc etc to help display metrics and answer general officer KPIs for ISR. My SQL knowledge is pretty beginner but I understand the basics very well and it has been mainly self taught.

I am looking to make this career shift in the next 2-4 years after I finish my MS and AAS. I do not have much experience on the coding side of the house, and it seems my AAS is more tailored for DBA type jobs or jobs that rely mainly on SQL and Oracle. I am always open to more self-education to broaden my tool kit.

In your guys professional opinions, how qualified would I be for data science jobs once I complete my education? What else should I be focusing on? What self teaching methods have you used to help gain knowledge? 

This is a massive career change for me as I am a SME in my current field. I get anxiety thinking about being qualified or good enough to find myself in a data scientist position. I just do not have passion or interest in my current field anymore and need a change that keeps me interested and always learning more.",Snape_Grass,65,613,1517497625.0,1587265998.923008

ft0coi,True,"Looking to land a DS role via MOOC, Boot Camp, Let's talk","For those looking to jump to a data science role and are leveraging MOOC or Boot Camps and do not have relevant experience or a STEM degree...here's how sht goes down in reality

There are a lot of MOOC Certs and Bootcamps popping up on resumes at my company. There's nothing wrong with either per se, but people should manage their expectations after completing them without having a degree in those areas or significant projects with added complexity (going a step beyond school assignments). To caveat the latter, some schools take an applied approach and allow/encourage students to pick real-world business applications (e.g. a problem at work if they're remote students or require an industry practicum project/s) using real datasets. I got it. We get it.

Now let's get on with it

My company is hiring for remote work (remote work is temporary until we get things back to 'normal' as possible). So I was checking e-mails and our HR has thousands of applicants. I was assigned a portion to assist in filtering through them for data science roles. I focused on the MOOC and Bootcamp population.

Added thoughts - people are doing a good job at filtering through ATS. That said, that's actually a bad thing because now we may consider making it even harder to get through ATS by changing the parameters. When that happens, it turns into companies asking for unicorns that don't exist. Anyway, networking is key.

**My criteria for evaluating applicants:**

**High Importance:**

has STEM degree (bachelor or master or PhD)

has GitHub link

has relevant experience but no STEM degree

has relevant STEM minor or coursework listed on their resume but no terminal STEM degree

**Low Importance:**

completed a MOOC or Boot Camp

has LinkedIn link (looking to see are you serious about your career, what's your personal brand, are you even following our company---> HR can see who is and who is not following via LinkedIn)

**What I did**

I did not look at every resume attached. I downloaded them all. Did some EDA. About 45% of the 600 resumes I had included people trying to transition to data science. Of that 45%, I saw that 57% of them had no STEM background or relevant experience or STEM minor or relevant coursework listed. So I dropped them and focused on the remaining 43%. Because I'm lazy, I created another subgroup to classify applicants who listed a link to their GitHub and those who didn't. Those who didn't were dropped. I checked every 10th resume's GitHub and most of the ""projects"" were school assignments. Okay, I get it. I had to use this metric to narrow the filed. (Fact, I never included a GitHub link on my resume when I jumped to a DS role. I do have real projects from my master's but I chose a managerial role that didn't require an in-depth coding interview given to SDEs - though I did do a coding interview - my university's reputation really negated an intensive exploration of my coding ability).

If I called the samples, I'd ask about one of those projects and have them walk me through their code. I ended up calling 7 people. I scheduled - later that same day via Zoom - a 25-min coding interview. For each person, I asked an entry-level Leet Code question about merging two sorted lists yadda yadda. Not one of those seven got it right. I walked them through the code. The lightbulb came on and they were like, 'omg how did I not know that."" I gave them another easy-level Leet Code question about summing. They all got that within 2 minutes. I gave them another easy one about reverse integers. They got that and I'm like (oh so that's interesting). I gave them a medium one about searching through a sorted array. These bastards got that too. And I thought to myself, they have the foundation and potential, they just need more hands-on experience. It was funny because I WAS JUST LIKE THEM.

Of those 7, only 3 were able to talk through their code and logic used. 4 of them seemed like they were struggling to explain why they did x y or z. I even heard one typing (but I didn't call them out on it). I just reminded that person that I didn't really care about right or wrong, I want to see how they think through problems because coding is different when it's not a school assignment. This guy keeps typing LOL. So I turned up my speaker volume, grabbed a coffee from the kitchen, came back, this assclown was still typing. So I spent the remaining time trying to guess which type of keys the guy was using on his keyboard - I broke his train of thought when I asked him - ""hey are those Cherry MX red keys."" This fox stopped and said ""no they're Cherry MX browns."" Eventually, he found a solution. So I said okay that works, now walk me through why you chose it. LOL. He couldn't. The guy had a BS in Actuarial Science (so I know he's smart), but you know that's life you smug bastard.

I recommended 3 to HR with a caveat. Each person has weak coding skills but are suitable candidates for junior roles that we typically give to interns and recent graduates. I called all three back and said, they were basically trash (not in those words), but I feel based on their STEM background, work experience, and GitHub efforts, and our pre-screening coding interview, and recent discussions - that I recommended that they be considered for Junior Dev/SDE roles. I made it clear that my recommendation is a referral and not a job offer. Outside of that, I have no control.

* **SQL**: For some reason, this is a huge hole. 90% of DS is data cleaning and manipulation. Don't just know the syntax; know how to manipulate raw product tables to get the data you want, and be able to defend your pulls to business line owners and stakeholders when they ask why you're showing them what you're showing them.  
* **Logic and self deduction skills**: I'm not just talking about math-like logic. This includes business and interpersonal logic as well. For example, why is this person asking this? What is the “whole board” they’re seeing?
* **Ability to check your data and findings against the product output / business situation**: How do you know what you pulled is right? That your findings make sense? Do your numbers hold water against someone who knows the product data and inter-workings inside and out?
* **Non technical stakeholder communication skills**: This includes presentations, building rapport and relationships, managing up, managing different attitudes, understanding perspectives, understanding how to ask questions and listen between the lines, building strong daily partnerships
* **Business strategy skills**: Now that you’ve completed this project, now what? What does this mean for the business? How do you see the whole board and make a recommendation that fits in? 
* **Grit and attitude**: AKA the ability to wrangle through messy problem,  messy data, and with messy relationships and politics. Know how to get through the mess, how to self problem solve, and when to call in favors. Also, have a willingness to do grunt work, like write SQL, or figure out what the product data is, how it is produced, and wtf the engineers were thinking when they structured the product in that way.
* **Politicking and relationship building**: understand how to work with product, biz line owners, execs, etc to solve problems. Have a strong willingness to HELP OTHERS! 
* **Tableau / data viz in some way**: be able to clearly relay your findings, with ""like I'm 5"" attitude, to people who are not comfortable with even basic bar charts or graphs. You should be able to look at a graph at a glance and consume what it is telling you. 

Then... python/R, special packages, math, modeling, etc. 

I see so many people worried about x language or Y package, where I actually think those are relatively easy to learn. The soft skills aren’t taught in school and are VERY important - and the hardest to find! 

Honestly, analysts and data scientists don't get to do the cool stuff all the time. There is a lot of boring stuff that is easy to do, technically. I built a dashboard the other day that took me maybe 4-6 hours from start (coding) to finish, and people falling over themselves in excitement. It wasn't fancy, but it made it VERY easy for them to get what they needed, quickly. 

What do other hiring managers think?

**EDIT TO ADD:**
* When all else is equal, we hire based on culture and team fit, and willingness to learn. **Attitude and fit often outweigh technical skills!**

* The requisite mastery level certainly does depend on the job level. For more junior level candidates, I understand when you haven’t developed those yet... but how is your attitude? Do you think you know everything bc you have the hard skills down? Or do you recognize that you are just starting out and the soft skills are what you need to learn? 

You’d be surprised at how many people graduate with a MS or PhD, but have no work experience, and think they deserve senior level roles. Sorry... drop the ego, you only know a little bit of what you actually need to know to be successful. 

* Re: how to convey this in an interview / resume, or how to ask interview questions - you ask performance based questions. “Tell me about a time you partnered with a non technical stakeholder to solve a business problem”. 

Talk about how you solved the business problem first, then about the tools you used to get there. I like hearing about cool stuff, but I also need to know you can do the basic stuff and the soft skills REALLY well. 

* Re: starting my own business and my skill level - obviously I’m not 100% at all of these things. No one is! We all have areas to grow. Also, I don’t want to work on my own.

* Per a comment, I cleaned up my formatting :)

* We hire for a well rounded team. Everyone has a different background. Not everyone is going to know everything. That is ok. Lean on what you're good at, have an attitude that focuses on continuous learning, and be a strong team player.",Pinkpenguin438,378,580,1556943103.0,1587265998.923008

fvnzga,True,Finance Professional/CPA Wanting to Pivot Toward BI/Data Science - Help?,"Hi All,

I'm a CPA with a Big 4 firm that works primarily on performing due diligence for M&A transactions. At the sub-Manager level, where I reside, my work heavily revolves around working with large datasets, cleaning/parsing them in various ways, and then creating visuals/analysis within Excel.

Finance is well behind the curve when it comes to tech, so I began trying to figure out how to become more efficient at modeling data that's millions of rows large sometimes (often in dog shit format) since excel started to crash when files got large. Besides gaining some additional advanced excel skills for performing more complicated lookups, I realized a few things:

* I learned very elementary Python (Regex to scrape PDFs and using Pandas to combine, sort, filter datasets so I can do the analysis in Excel for my manager to review) and realized that I really enjoy the challenge of coding. I don't want to be a developer of apps or whatever, but successfully figuring out how to program the computer to do manual tasks gave me more time to do the part of the job that I enjoy. Which leads me to point 2
* Finance and I still want to be involved with financial departments, but a lot of forecasting in finance is just GIGO. Especially in the M&A world, most business deals are done via very optimistic assumptions about growth rate projections, etc. What I really enjoyed about buyside deals was figuring out how to use data as my ally to knock down deal valuations for my client (i.e. constructing an analysis using historical data to question the growth rates and knock a few million off the purchase price)
* I'm a very analytical person and want to use statistical methods more often in my finance work to help companies improve their bottom lines/cut costs.

I'm wondering what I could do to transition from a financial analysis & transformation type of position to a more BI-oriented role where I can apply more advanced quantitative methods to finance. My passion is still finance at the end of the day, but I think bringing a more quantitative approach will not only help me be better at my job, but also help future proof me a little bit more, given that's where the world is trending.

Are Masters in Business Analytics/Business Statistics a viable option for gaining credibility and would they look at someone with a finance background/accounting degree? If not, what can I do in my spare time to make the move someday?

fvyrky,False,Dealing with Unrealistic Expectations as Employee #2,"Wondering if anyone can help me out in my current situation

&#x200B;

**Tl;dr** the company that just hired me is not ready for data scientists. I’m being asked to do things that are very far from my expertise, but I also have no other job prospects. I also really like the field the app is in, have a ton of time while under quarantine, and the motivation to try and make as much of this work as possible. Any help is appreciated.

\----

I’m a data science bootcamp graduate (I know, I know. I apologize for existing.) and not surprisingly have been struggling to find my entry into the field, but I was getting interviews, particularly in my area/domain of interest. Then the virus hit the US and all my prospects shriveled, except for one. It’s a startup in my domain, an app where users would make decisions regarding a particular “score”.

&#x200B;

Originally, we had discussed integrating with his development team (working with them on an initial model of the aforementioned “score”) - then, as the initial model is productionalized, I would switch to data-driven content creation (data viz, dashboards, articles and presentations for non-tech users) to help in communicating technical aspects the product internally, and marketing the product externally, an area of the field I enjoy. Great.

&#x200B;

Well, we negotiated equity, and I sign-on, and it turns out I’m the first (and only) full-time employee. The development team is all freelance. The company has no data engineers, so the founder has asked me for guidance on setting up historical data from an API on our own servers. The extent of my data engineering knowledge is: I’ve used SQL to connect to preexisting architectures, and I’ve seen people use Spark/Hive/Hadoop. I’m researching Apache Airflow like a madman, but (obviously) in way over my head.

&#x200B;

He also wants me to spearhead the marketing campaign. There is no website. There is no chosen domain. But I’ve had dozens of pages of “marketing book notes” delivered to me, and I’m supposed to turn it into some kind of plan for my own content, then execute said plan. He wants me to be the lead on creating strategic partnerships within the industry. While I love ""making things"" (I'm also a YT/podcast content creator for fun), I’m not a marketer at whatsoever and don't have some big list of in-industry contacts, so... I’m just completely in the dark there.

&#x200B;

I know a ton of people would just peace out and look for another job, but since I've got no other options at the moment: for those who have been in similar situations and stuck it out: who’ve dealt with a founder/boss with unrealistic expectations re: what one entry-level data scientist can do, I’d love to hear how you went about A) your work (what tools/resources) you saught-out and B) how you handled communicating unrealistic expectations while still doing your level-best to rise to the occasion.

I received my Bachelors in Statistical Science (combo of math, stats, coding) in  Jun 2019 and I have been working as a full time data scientist since I graduated. My manager said that the company  would pay for any bootcamps I want to attend.

A coworker is taking this bootcamp [https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-remote-online](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-remote-online), but it seems somewhat introductory?

I am comfortable working with Python, R, SQL. I think I'm a pretty good coder, but I would like to learn more and get better. I really enjoy coding!  I know enough Javascript and HTML to do my job (interactive dashboards using D3js). I'm familiar with ML and have done projects, but I'm not super comfortable. Also, I learned all the math and stats in college, but I haven't done much data analysis in the real world yet so it would be nice to practice those skills. Also never learned any big data stuff, so maybe it's time to learn Hadoop? Not sure.

Has anyone done any bootcamps that they can recommend that are for fine tuning these data science skills that you already have and learning more complex things?

Thanks so much!",goldganggang,641,216,1544486832.0,1587265998.923008

fx3xyz,False,Books on Data Science/Machine Learning impact,"I am a data scientist/ML engineer trying to get to know different  angles for looking at my profession, especially how it may affect people  with other background.

In the last years I read some books, but probably they're biased  (being written by people who did it professionally, at least at some  point)  


* *Master Algorithm* by Domingos (good book, but it's sort of popular science on ML and the social aspect part is very weak IMO, because it is full of hype and reads more like a sales pitch than result of some analysis) 
* *Weapons of Math Destruction* by O'Neill - it touches some relevant points. I'm not sure about the validity given O'Neill's track record though - she once lamented how no one does research on AI fairness (this was in a newspaper article, it was not long ago, when there were established programs and research groups on that). Also book is very political and might sometimes be annoying if you don't exactly lean left 
* *Outnumbered* by David Sumpter - this is by far the best book I've read, it's well balanced, like for example the author mentions different metrics that were used to assume whether algorithms made racist predictions or not. Also he doesn't push any ML hype, and actually finds there is no proof for some results that got huge media coverage.
* *Architects of Intelligence* \- it's a set of interviews with ML people. What is great about it is that you can see that there is no consensus on the future of the field, and that people who actually have impact have divergent opinions on some topics (like for example on regulation)

I'm looking for books preferably written by specialists (as opposed to journalists), also maybe if this becomes a big list someone will find it helpful.

My company provides retailers with pricing data collected by employees in the field. I am one of those Field Data Collectors. Basically I'm assigned several jobs at different stores throughout the week. Some jobs repeat weekly, or monthly, or quarterly. Some jobs require the collecting of certain items on a list, some requiring scanning every item in a category and collecting those prices. 

An example: every week Bullseye wants to know how Walcarts prices a specific 500 items at 20 different stores in the area. I'm assigned 3 stores, go into each of those stores and find the items, scan them, and input the prices. If that store does not carry the exact item I indicate it. Different DCs are assigned the different locations.

I don't even know what happens in my own company after I upload my job to submit the data i've collected, let alone what the retailer does with the data they're given. 

I'm just curious, why do these major retailers (and even some minor more local/ region specific retailers) contract with our company to get this data? What do they use it for? The company website sells itself as ""Our clients benefit from omni-channel, normalized, and actionable Pricing Intelligence at massive scale to inform on-target pricing strategy and maximize business impact."" What does that even mean? 

Another question I have, who benefits most from this data? Is it only the corporations, or is there any benefit to the consumer as well? 

Also, when Bullseye wants pricing from Walcarts, Walcarts sends us to a Rokger banner, and Rokger finally asks for Bullseye data, does that really end up benefiting anybody? They're all getting data from eachother in a circular manner.

fyrjip,True,How to get an Internship in Data Science- for Undergraduates,"Warning- This will be a long post

So much of Tech centers around Software Engineering and Software Development. They are great disciplines, but not everyone is interested in them. Many people, myself included, are interested in Data Science and Analytics. I see so much great information on this sub (much of it has helped me) but a lot of it is geared towards people with Master's and PhD's. This will be a post about what I did to score two different internship offers in this discipline (as an Undergraduate Junior). Keep in mind that due to the current climate (COVID19) it will be very hard to get an internship. However, most of this advice could be used for next year or even the context of getting a full time job. 

A little about me- I'm an undergraduate Junior at a good state University studying Information Science with a specialization in Data Science. I have a 2.88 GPA and have no prior internships. I was an ambassador for my major for a while as well as worked in my campus IT department. I applied to around 120 positions with many different companies (around 60) and got interviews with companies such as Paypal, T-Mobile, Fidelity Investments, Hewlett Packard, and more. I ended up getting 2 offers- one as a Corporate Analyst (Big Cable Company) and one as a system engineer (big financial company). Here's my advice. 

&#x200B;

**1. Have something on your resume besides your education that's relevant.** This is very important. Some examples are TAing for a relevant class, working in your school's IT Department, or doing research. This shows that you do things besides just go to class. You gain valuable experience and learn things. Furthermore, it's something to talk about. I was asked about my IT Job in every single interview- I wasn't asked about my GPA in a single interview. Getting something relevant like this will be a huge boost on your resume.

2. **Learn to communicate- well.** I know its a stereotype, but there are many people in STEM who just aren't good at communicating. They have a difficult time maintaining eye contact, have trouble holding a conversation, are boring to talk to, or give off a poor vibe in an interview. Much of a job interview is getting the interviewer to like you. It doesn't matter how smart or qualified you are- if you have a poor time communicating why you're a good fit and qualified you're likely not going to get the offer. Learning to communicate is such an important skill and one that you can't neglect.

3. **Apply Everywhere- Seriously.** So many different companies offer internships in this discipline. Many you wouldn't even expect. Pepsi offers Internships. So does Coca Cola. Every insurance company (Farmer's, Progressive, Geico, etc.) All of the Telecom Companies (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, etc.). Target has internships as does Walmart. Lowes? The home improvement store? Yup. Advance Auto Parts does also. Banks? Absolutely (Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Ally Bank, etc.- most of the smaller banks also offer good internship programs). Those are just big companies- so many other big companies offer internships in this discipline, as well as countless other small companies and startups. Don't just apply to Airbnb and Uber and Amazon and Google- branch out and apply everywhere. 

4. **Don't Just Apply to ""Data Science Internship""** This is a very important one. So many companies will offer internships in Big Data which aren't called ""Data Science Internship"". I've applied to jobs with titles such as Data Analyst Intern, Business Analyst Intern, Business Intelligence Intern, Big Data Intern, Analytics Intern, Systems Analyst Intern, and so much more- apply to jobs of all kinds- however, read the description! This is very important. Both of my internship offers aren't explicitly Data Science Internships, but both involve working and dealing with Data/Analytics in various capacities. 

 5. **You don't have to be a coding genius** This field in general deals much less with programming than Software Development. With that being said, make sure that you have utilized various programming languages in various ways and have experience. Don't have to be a master but should have used them before. The languages to know are Python, SQL, and R. These are by far the most important and relevant ones. Again, you don't have to master them, but make sure that you are familiar and some experience. 

5. **Do side projects**\- These are really important. They give you something to showcase and talk about. If you like politics, do yours on Politics. If you like sports do one on sports. If you like music do one on music. Do a side project of something that interests you. I like politics and economics so both are my projects pertained to that. 

6. **Just because you interview well doesn't mean you get the job**\- This is something very important to learn, especially in Data Science. I had many interviews which went great and I didn't get the job. In fact, I was nearly certain I got an offer after my PayPal Interview. I traveled 2 hours, missed a school day, and had an absolutely great conversation with everyone. I could tell from their body language and responses that I did great. I didn't get it. I did well on the interview- but there's always someone better than you. I might have done well- but someone with a PhD might have also done well- and is more experienced. Guess who they're gonna choose? This is something very important to keep in mind. 

7. **Don't put all of your eggs in one basket**\- I had an interview for a really big company (Forbes 50) for a position on their IDM Team (Deals with Data). I was super confident after the interview- I nailed it. Hours later, I got a call from another company (Big Cable company- Fortune 100) wanting to set up a final interview. I almost said I wasn't interested, because I was so confident in my previous interview. Guess what? I didn't get that job. But I did get the offer for the previously Cable Company. In fact, it was my only offer for 4 months before I got a better offer. So again, be very careful. If I told them I wasn't interested I wouldn't have had an offer- very grateful I didn't. 

8. **Have a good Resume-** This is cliche so I'm gonna offer things which I put which I believe you should put on your resume. 1) Github- include a github link with projects on it. 2) Include a Tableau link- here I was able to showcase some of the visualizations that I did. 3) Relevant classes I took- many people don't do this but should. It's a great way to show what specific topics you've studied. Finally, make sure your resume is well written, neat, and interesting.

Here's the list without all the intro BS. Please do comment if you have some items to add! :

# Chapter 1 : General Structure

* Is there an established map of the database?
* Is it visible to all users?
* Is there a public strategy of how it is tested for truth?
* Are there known party(ies) responsible for updating it when there are structural changes?
* How often is it updated?
* When is the next scheduled update?
* Is there a change log to track prior changes?
* Is there a group of humans you can go to with questions?
* Is there a group of humans you can go to with general conversational topics?
* The user list from a DBA is great for this.
* Consider having a monthly meeting and yearly summit per database. Remember, this is YOUR responsibility. Not the owner of the database.
* If the source of data is an application or form, is there a map from every entry field to the corresponding field in the database?
* Capacity / Uptime
* How concerned should you be with locking up the database with poorly written queries?
* Who do you go to when it is dead?
* Is the data backed up / archived anywhere?
* For how long?
* Do you remove old values from the production database after archiving?
* Are queries logged?
* How often is the database refreshed, if it is part of an ETL?
* Automatically check, at the appropriate time, if it has been updated. Have a plan in place for when it is inevitably not updated.
* What is the official way to request access to the database?
* Is there a time-out process of old user ID’s?
* Have a plan in place for when an automated procedure’s stored credentials are suddenly invalid.

**Tables**

* Is there any rhyme or reason to the naming of tables?
* If there are very similar tables (ie. CUSTOMER, CUSTOMER\_NEW, CUSTOMER\_NEW\_NEW), do the alternates need to exist?
* Is this table “one row that is constantly kept updated” or “one row for each time the data changes”?

**Joins**

* Should there be at least one “Child” for every “Parent”?
* Is there a maximum expected “Children” for every “Parent”?
* Should there be “Children” who don’t have “Parents”?
* Is every table relatable to every other table?
* On joining fields
* Do the field types match, or do you need to do a conversion?
* Queries / Processes
* Is the query properly notated?
* With the code removed, the notes should be copy and paste-able to a non-technical business partner.
* The notes should represent reality. Please.
* Is it possible to do an “anti-query”?
* Reverse your filters, but mirror your production process. In high value pipelines, this can be a huge preventative measure for errors, and an easy way to provide “free” extra value.
* Is it possible to do the query by hand on a small subset of records?
* If so, do this periodically. Seriously. I know you got into this line of business to not do this stuff manually, but doing this periodically can help verify all systems are working properly.
* Is the process entirely automated?
* If not, don’t launch.
* This includes any of the tests below that say “periodically”, if possible.
* Is it possible to store the results of every query, along with a timestamp of run (especially as part of an ETL process?)
* Are you choosing a “whitelist” approach, or a “blacklist” approach?
* If there are changes after launch — will you be applying those changes to previous projects, or leaving them in place with old (and potentially inaccurate) data?

# Chapter 2 : Data Types

**All / General**

* Are null values allowed?
* Are the fields expected to change over time? If the answer is “no”, take hashes of lines at the time of development and test periodically to see if they change. If the answer is “yes”, take extracts with timestamps in the name and only use those (instead of production) for reproducibility.
* Expert level — Create a X / Y grid of every field against every other field. Have all parties involved in development (especially the humans that are the source of the data) write assumptions and rules that come up in each cell (if this field is “beer” this other field should be “$5.99”) Document all of these. If something looks wrong and the customer says “that’s ok”, DOCUMENT THIS. With audio evidence if possible. Video isn’t bad either.

**General Text (Free entry)**

* If there is a default size, why is the default size set to the size it is?
* Is the field having an identity crisis — does it only contain integers, dates, locations, etc.? If so — should it be converted to the correct type? What do you do with those that can’t be converted?
* Does the text contain invisible characters that will cause it to print strangely (line-break)?
* Does the text contain special (or international) characters? Should it? If you are planning on exporting to .csv downstream, are you removing commas upstream (or tabs, or pipes, etc.).
* Is there a list of “stop words” that should be applied? Especially inappropriate words. Don’t let an f-bomb get into a shareholder report.

**Categorical Text (Unique list of values)**

* Store the unique values at the time you are developing, and the counts of each value. Periodically test for new/missing values. Have a plan in place for when this inevitably happens.
* Periodically test for wild changes in distribution. Communicate these to anyone who will listen. This will make you a hero. Provide this list to stakeholders during development. This is always interesting, because often it is vastly different than their estimate.
* If there are multiple categorical fields, is there an hierarchy that is documented and should be followed (if veh\_type is “car”, then veh\_brand can only be “audi”, “ford”, “toyota” etc.). Have a plan in place for when this inevitably breaks.
* Is the field indexed for fast grouping?
* If the values are text numbers (one, two, three) — should they be converted to integers (1, 2, 3)?

**Boolean (True/False)**

* If these represent a “switch” in the process, should the downstream impact also be represented in data? (if override\_price=0 then discount\_price should never be null)
* Store the distribution at the time of developing, and periodically test for changes. Communicate these to anyone who will listen.
* Does True or False have a different name to you customers? IE, 0 = No Sale, 1 = Sale.
* What should you do with nulls, if there are any?

**ID (Keys, AutoNum)**

* Is the ID an AutoNum? If so, are there missing values?
* Is the ID a complex key? Do characters in the complex key relate to the data in any way? Periodically test that this remains true.
* Are duplicates allowed?
* Are you operating under the assumption that the ID for any given record will never change (maintaining an extract or join to a private table)? Have a plan in place for when they inevitably do.
* If you remove the ID from the equation, are there any two completely identical rows?

**General Number/Integer**

* Does null = 0?
* Are negative values expected?
* Are decimals expected? If not, is there rounding occurring upstream? What are the rounding rules?
* Is there a maximum/minimum expected value? Record the minimum and maximum value at the time of development. Periodically test to see if this record has been broken.
* Is there an expected distribution? Periodically test to see if this has changed.
* Is the number secretly categorical (only certain allowed values)?
* Does the number increase in steps instead of linearly (100, 150, 200, 250…)?
* Is the number secretly a phone number or postal code?
* Is there any chance that the number has been cut off to fit in a smaller field (I’m looking at you, Smallint)?
* Is any number field the result of math on other number fields (price\*tax=total)?
* Is there a business preferred format for showing numbers (commas, negative signs)?

**Currency**

* Is there an assumed currency? If not, is there a categorical field that will tell you what currency it is?
* If the record also has a “country” — does the currency match the country?
* Are you converting these currencies to a single currency downstream? If so, store the conversion rates at the time of development.
* Is there a maximum sane currency? Record the maximum and test frequently. Have a plan in place for when it is inevitably broken.
* Does null = 0?
* Does the value represent a “current” value, or a “point in time” value (current price of product, price of product between 2018 and 2019)?
* Are there negative values? Does negative represent a debit or a credit to the company?

**General Contact Information**

* Is there a schedule for updating contact information?
* When was the information last updated?
* When was the information last successfully used?
* If you use this information for any purpose, store the information at the time of use, and the reason for use. If possible, get as many employees as possible to do this in the same location using the same format.
* Do any two customers have the same piece of contact information?
* Does any contact information match your own company/office information?
* Does any customer’s information match that of a current or former employee?
* Is there a no-marketing list that you should be aware of? Ask multiple people and get excited when there are multiple answers!

**Phone Numbers**

* Is there an assumed country code? If not, is the country code stored in another field?
* Do not assume the country of residence is the country code of the phone number.
* Does the phone number follow the rules of that country code?
* Is there an assumed area code?
* Is the area code a toll free area code?
* Is the area code a legitimate area code?
* Is the phone number stored as text?
* Is there any rhyme or reason to the formatting of the phone number? If it is text, is there a single format? What do you do with numbers that do not match that format?
* Is there a preferred format for displaying phone numbers?
* Are you removing “bogus” phone numbers (All the same digits, counting up, etc.).
* If there is a dialer campaign that returns invalid phone numbers, is anything being done with that information?

**Mailing Address**

* Is there an assumed country? If not, is the country stored in another field?
* Is the address free entry text, or cleaned via a service?
* If it is cleaned, what happens to un-cleanable records?
* Is the Postal Code -> State/Region -> Country strictly enforced?
* Is the mailing address in an expected area of business?
* Is there an additional “APT” or “PO BOX” field? Should you be aware of this?
* If there is a latitude/longitude field, does it match the address? Do many customers have the same latitude/longitude?

**Sensitive PII**

* Are these fields humanely appropriate for modeling or analysis (ethnicity, income)?
* Do you need to be aware of HIPAA guidelines?

**Financial Information**

* God help you if your company is storing unmasked financial information.
* Did two different customers make a transaction with the same credit card? Or the same last four digits and expiration date?
* See what your most popular card type is and and provide this to your marketing department if there is a clear winner, for use with reward programs.

**Date / Time**

* Is this a system recorded timestamp field, or human entry?
* Is the time being stored with an assumed time zone?
* Store the minimum date-time during development. Periodically check to see if this has changed.
* Are there any dates with missing information? For example, there are sales every day of February except the 12th.
* Are there records outside business hours?
* Are there any fields that look like they were entered before their timestamp (people trying to create records in the past)?
* Are there any dates that are in the future?
* Do you need to have a specific game plan for leap years?
* Do you need to have a specific game plan for holidays?
* When counting records by day or hour, are there any outliers?Communicate this to stakeholders as soon as possible. Check this frequently — it’s valuable information and will make you famous when you catch something. Additionally, it will ruin your model if there was a rare event.
* If there are multiple date fields, should they have an order of operations (field2 should always be after field1).
* Does everyone know what “biweekly” means?
* Does everyone know what “midnight” means?
* Is there a business preferred date format?
* For forecasting purposes - keep a separate table telling you what dates to NOT take into account when training forecast models. IE - Hurricanes, marketing campaigns, giant international pandemics.
* Do you have a plan for daylight savings time?

g0ijxj,False,"Been perpetually baffled ever since stepping into the field as to why Matplotlib is considered a staple for DS in Python, beyond very basic EDA. Matplotlib experts - do help shed some light!","While I've found myself using Python *extensively* for all kinds of Data Cleaning, machine learning, and a number of other more software engineering-related things, visualization is one thing I find myself resorting to much easier options for. 

Beyond very elementary data visualization during EDA stages that serves just to paint a clearer picture in my mind of what a physical representation of my data might look like, I'm pretty stumped as to what more matplotlib offers. Does it really bring something to the table that not only makes it worth the trouble of trying to learn it properly despite its unintuitive rules, but also makes it superior to other options that are plain easier and less time consuming?

I'm not dense enough to think that people who take the time to get extremely good at it don't have their reasons - I'm just really eager to learn what those are.

g0is1r,False,Uncomfortable as data scientist: looking for guidance,"This may not be a super structured post, but I just want to get something off my chest: I'm 24 years old, and around 6 months ago I joined as a data scientist at a consulting firm (for people who care, MBB) and I am extremely uncomfortable in my position. I simply feel like I don't know enough, and that I never will.. At the same time, I find the work very rewarding and technically interesting, and I definitely want to stay in the field. This leads to the realization that if I am to stay in the field, I should find ways to deal with this discomfort. Maybe you guys can help me..

I have a background in aerospace engineering, and got into the field by basically doing self study (understanding the math behind most basic algorithms, applying them to Kaggle problems, and getting as good as possible in Python). I interned as a data scientist where I basically did nothing academic (sort of a real-life Kaggle competition to be honest), and through some luck ended up in the position I am in now.

Fueled by imposter syndrome, I tend to spend most of my free time (weekends mainly) doing self study and trying to learn more. I am not doing this because I **have** to, I am genuinely interested in the field. However, it feels like there is so much to learn and it is starting to get to me.

To give some context, I have never done anything related to neural networks. I kind of know how it works on a high level and I know what backpropagation is and the math behind it, but I have never actually coded up any sort of deep learning model. I am definitely not comfortable in using it in my daily work.

I also don't know anything about Bayesian statistics. I have spent the last week or so going through numerous sources and am now comfortable with the idea of priors, likelihood functions, how to update the posterior, and various ways of finding the posterior (grid approximation/quadrature/MCMC). But again, I have never actually used it so I don't feel like I actually am capable of using it in my day-to-day work.

Just today I learned about the existence of Generalized Linear Models, and it is as if suddenly I am confronted with yet another beast which I had no idea existed. But guess what: if I truly want to be a good at what I do and be a master in my field, I have to learn this as well. And at this point, I don't even really know what it means.

I guess my general question is: how do you guys deal with this situation? There are seemingly infinite things to learn about, and then each of those things can be learned to an arbitrary level of detail. How do you pick what to learn/focus on, and how do you decide that ""enough is enough?"".

Also, how do you decide if something you learned off-the-job is useful in your daily work? Having conceptual understanding is one thing, but actually applying it requires quite a leap of faith in knowing what you know.",CatGoesWooof,590,1112,1478635181.0,1587265998.923008

g0p6rx,True,Good book for learning R/Python/SQL? (+ seeking for guidance),"Hello everyone

I'm a brazilian MSc. student in Operations Research field and I'm really close to finishing my masters. I have a bachelor's degree in Chemical engineering but I always loved working with programming and optimization, and due to unemployment a couple of years ago, I decided to pursue a master's degree in Operations Research. 

Today, I work mostly with integrated logistics problems, like vehicle/inventory routing problems. I have fairly good knowledge of C++ (however not at a ""programmer"" level) and good experience with softwares like Gurobi and CPLEX. I also have professional experience with Outsystems, software used for web/mobile development (this taught me how to develop web pages and mobiles apps FAST, however, I don't have all that knowledge of HTML and SQL, for instance).

Now that I'm about to finish my master's, I'm at a crossroads, since I don't know if I' want to pursue a phD or if I want to work with operations research. Since I have a very ""mixed"" formation, I don't think that I'm as skilled as a full-time programmer is, with deep knowledge of languages like HTML, SQL, python, or even C++, which I'm good at in comparison to other engineers in my field. I've been looking for jobs and I saw many similar opportunities: data science related jobs, that require usually:

\- knowledge of Python and/or Java;

\- R;

\- SQL and HTML knowledge;

\- PowerBI, Apache and/or similar softwares. 

I'm aware that languages like python are very simple in comparison to C++, and I even believe that the current frameworks are very similar today. My main fear, however, is not being able to compete with programmers, which have more knowledge of multiple programming languages, or people that already have experience with data science softwares, like the one mentioned.

Since I'm more of a ""book"" kind of guy, instead of an ""online course"" one, I was trying to search for a book that contemplated the most of the topics that I mentioned above, to try to spare time and to learn an integrated approach from the beginning. I don't have anything against online courses... is just that there are so many of them available, that it becomes difficult to assess which are good and which aren't. My priorities are learning Python/R/SQL, but I'm up for anything.

Once upon a time, there was a task given (this was a decade back when excel & vlookup were the 2 of 3 famous terms in the world of analytics).  
As the story goes… this was for a retail industry, we did some analytics around the products that customers are purchasing. 1. What are the products they are looking at & searching? 2. What are the commonalities, pattern, segmentation etc etc.  
End of the day, we had to analyse hundreds of thousands of transactions; thousands of people, their purchase and invoices;

We found an interesting pattern happening very often. When people shop in the evening between 6 and 9. **Customers who buy diapers also buy beer**.

&#x200B;

But, this insight was like out of the blue completely as these 2 products are completely not connected.  
***Why would somebody buy beer when they’re buying diapers or why buy diapers when they’re buying beer!!!***  
So that was the fact we came across in the data and the explanations as fact. **One of the plausible explanations we gave;** In the evenings, when the husband gets home and when they take care of their baby; they sometimes find that they run out of diapers and who has to go pick up the diapers.. well, the husband. The wife sends husband to go pick up the diapers and **while he is picking up the diapers because its already after work hours, he also picks up some beer. Right.**

And this plausible explanation might be logical or not be. This is something you can’t really think of it just by yourself but that comes from the data.

As I’ve highlighted this in my previous [***post***](https://medium.com/@karthik.thandapani/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-recommendation-system-f6c0054dfb7c?source=friends_link&sk=70c9b7177a1e731b3c742aca26ae22e7), based on certain insights derived from data; a supermarket or retail industry can decide how to arrange products in your shelf **whether you run an e-commerce store to rank & show your products in your virtual shelf or a superstore to put these 2 products to entice people while shopping.**

So there is a lot of interesting marketing tactics that are using based on this data. But the question is; how do you get to this data?

**And one of the ways to get to it is leveraging analytics use apriori algorithm.**

# Problem Statement

When we go grocery shopping, we often have a standard list of things to buy. Each shopper has a distinctive list, depending on one’s needs and preferences. A housewife might buy healthy ingredients for a family dinner, while a bachelor might buy beer and chips. Understanding these buying patterns can help to increase sales in several ways. If there is a pair of items, X and Y, that are frequently bought together:  
*Both X and Y can be placed on the same shelf, so that buyers of one item would be prompted to buy the other.*  
*Promotional discounts could be applied to just one out of the two items.*  
*Advertisements on X could be targeted at buyers who purchase Y.*  
*X and Y could be combined into a new product, such as having Y in flavors of X.*

Association rules are “if-then rules” with two measures which quantify the support and confidence of the rule for a given data set. Having their origin in market basket analysis, association rules are now one of the most popular tools in data mining. This popularity is to a large part due to the availability of efficient algorithms. The first and arguably most influential algorithm for efficient association rule discovery is Apriori.

**Besides increasing sales profits, association rules can also be used in other fields. In medical diagnosis for instance, understanding which symptoms tend to co-morbid can help to improve patient care and medicine prescription.**  
Folks from healthcare industry, are you reading this ?

# Definition

Association rules analysis is a technique to uncover how items are associated to each other. There are three common ways to measure association.

1. **Support:**  
This says how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. In Table 1 below, the support of {apple} is 4 out of 8, or 50%. Itemsets can also contain multiple items. For instance, the support of {apple, beer, rice} is 2 out of 8, or 25%.

2. **2. Confidence:**  
This will highlight how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears. In diagram below, the confidence of {apple -> beer} is 3 out of 4, or 75%.

**3. Lift:**  
Table below how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, while controlling for how popular item Y is. In diagram below, the lift of {apple -> beer} is 1,which implies no association between items. A lift value greater than 1 means that item Y is likely to be bought if item X is bought, while a value less than 1 means that item Y is unlikely to be bought if item X is bought.

**Association Rule Mining**  
Now that we understand how to quantify the importance of association of products within an itemset, the next step is to generate rules from the entire list of items and identify the most important ones. This is not as simple as it might sound. Supermarkets will have hundred of thousands of different products in store. After some simple calculations, it can be shown that just 10 products will lead to 57000 rules!! And this number increases exponentially with the increase in number of items.  
Finding lift values for each of these will get computationally very very expensive. How to deal with this problem? How to come up with a set of most important association rules to be considered? Apriori algorithm comes to our rescue for this.

**Lets build an efficient recommendation system in R studio**

1. Load data
2. Install apriori
3. Data pre-processing | Decode sparse matrix | Plot
4. Train & Test
5. Visualize

In this example, we will work on a sample dataset from a grocery store, understand the business problem, and ways to optimize the sales using apriori algorithm leveraging machine learning.

I am debating between taking either the upper-division Linear Algebra course or a computer science course in C (have already worked heavily in python and java).

g1suaz,False,Is BERT too general for an NLP project with a very limited corpus with very specific contexts?,"I am working as a Machine Learning dev on an NLP project in the Aerospace industry. To give professional context, prior to this most of my ML work so far has been with structured numerical, ordinal, or categorical data from 3D simulations & video games and NLP is somewhat new to me. 

Specifically the goal is the following

1. Users take a picture of standardized work specifications with a custom app on their phones and then an OCR technology recognizes the text in the picture. (The OCR tech is already working)
2. A custom NLP tech classifies the text in the picture into specific classes and then populates a form in the app with the recognized text.

I am working on the NLP side and trying to decide which word embedding to use. The corpus for this project have meanings that are very specific to an Aerospace context (for example ""ceiling"" would relate to almost exclusively to the maximum altitude of an aircraft and NOT walls/floor/etc. ) and the amount of unique words on the work orders is likely no more than 2500-4000.

BERT's bidirectional approach seems like it would lead in general to accurate understanding of context, but I'm wondering if the pre-trained BERT models would be far too general an application like this where the context is ultra-specific.

My questions specifically are

1. Would a pre-trained BERT model be likely to overgeneralize here? 
2. Would training a BERT model from scratch (likely to do NER) be overkill? Would a simpler model be better here?",TrueObservations,849,1013,1425849150.0,1587265998.923008

Through this month I have not skipped a single day and I plan to continue my streak for 100 days. Also, I made some changes in my ""curriculum"" and wanted to provide some updates and feedback on my experience. There's tons of information and resources out there and it's really easy to get overwhelmed (Which I did before I came up with this plan), so maybe this can help others to organize better and get started.

&#x200B;

**Math:**

* Linear Algebra:
   * Udemy course:  [Become a Linear Algebra Master](https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-course/)
   * Book: [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B00PULZWPC)
   * YouTube: [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

I've been doing exercises from the book mainly but the Udemy course helps to explain some topics which seem confusing in the book. 3Blue1Brown YT is a great supplement as it helps to visualize all the concepts which are massive for understanding topics and application of the Linear algebra. I'm through 2/3 of the class and it already helps a lot with statistics part so it's must-do if you have not learned linear algebra before  


* **Statistical Learning**
   * Book: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/data.html)
   * YouTube 1: [Data Science Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB2p-jaoolkv0h22m4I9l9Q/videos)
   * YouTube 2: [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw)

ITSL is a great introductory book and I'm halfway through. Well explained with great examples, lab works and exercises. The book uses R but as a part of python practice, I'm reproducing all the lab works and exercises in Python. Usually, it's challenging but I learn way more doing this. (If you'll need python codes for this book's lab works let me know and I can share) The DSA YT channel just follows the ITSL chapter by chapter so it's a great way to read the book make notes and watch their videos simultaneously. StatQuest is an alternative YT channel that explains ML concepts clearly. After I'm done with ITSL I plan to continue with a more [advanced book from the same authors](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)  


**Programming**:

* I use the Dataquest Data Science path and usually, I do one-two missions per day. The program is well-structured and gives what you will need at the job, but has a small number of exercises. So when you learn something it's a good idea to get some data and practice on it. 
* Udemy: [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/learn/lecture/6453704?start=0#overview)
   * I use their videos after I finish the chapter in ITSL to see how t code regressions etc. But their explanation of statistics behind models is limited and vague. Anyway, a good tutorial for coding
* Book: [Think Python](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9EQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NDPR8R8GRQ8N&dchild=1&keywords=think+python&qid=1586982845&s=digital-text&sprefix=think+python%2Cdigital-text%2C139&sr=1-1)
   * Good intro book in python. I know the majority of concepts from this book but exercises are sweet and here and there I encounter some new topic.
* Leetcode/Hackerrank
   * Mainly for SQL practice. I spend around 40 minutes to 1 hour per day (usually 5 days per week). I can solve 70-80% of easy questions on my own. Plan to move to mediums when I'm done with Dataquest specialization.
* Projects:
   * Nothin massive yet. Mainly trying to collect, clean and organize data. Lots of you suggested getting really good at it, as usual, that's what entry-level analysts do so here I am. After a couple of days, I'm returning to my previous code to see where I can make my code more readable. Where I can replace lines of code with function not to be redundant and make more reusable code. And of course, asking for feedback. It amazes me how completely unknown people can take their time to give you comprehensive and thorough feedback! 

&#x200B;

I spend 4-5 hours minimum every day on the listed activities. I'm recording time when I actually study because it helps me to reduce the noise (scrolling on Reddit, FB, Linkedin, etc.). I'm doing 25-minute cycles (25 minutes uninterrupted study than a 5-minute break). At the end of the day, I'm writing a summary of what I learned during that day and what is the plan for the next day. These practices help a lot to stay organized and really stick to the plan. On the lazy days, I'm just reminding myself how bad I will feel If I skip the day and break the streak and how much gratification I will receive If I complete the challenge. That keeps me motivated. Plus material is really captivating for me and that's another stimulus. 

What can be a good way to improve my coding, stats or math? any books, courses, or practice will you recommend continuing my journey?

Any questions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome and encouraged! :D",Hellr0x,942,836,1565353844.0,1587265998.923008
g22ofj,True,What Master's degree is best in the long run? Does it matter?,"I am interested in the program at NCSU for Master's in Analytics. I also know their Statistics program is ranked pretty high as well. I have a few friends who went through the program after 8 months and were able to land $100k salary jobs. There are few things that I am looking for in a future career but not sure how it pans out when in the industry so wondering if anyone could shed some light.

My concern isn't that it's not possible to get the job doing the program (MSA) after hearing testimonials, but if the program is enough in the long term. I feel that those guys may get good jobs out the gate but maybe be out paced in the future. Does MSA build a good solid foundation on fundamentals to continue to be marketable and in demand in getting jobs in analytics, data science, big data? Or should I be pursuing Statistics?

I like programming/coding and wouldn't mind doing in daily (fairly fluent in java now). However, as I get older, I am told by software engineers that it's hard to keep up with the new technology so most transition into a managerial role. This is why I'm also leaning away from Computer Science specifically as a Master's and don't want to be replaced by fresh grads 10 years from now.

I enjoy the analytics side and would like to continue to grow in my knowledge of coding as well. I think I lean a bit more toward programming as something I enjoy and want to continue to be knowledge in data structures and algorithms.

I'm very confused at what direction to take and even un-sure if I'm asking the right questions.

g23gw3,False,FAANG Data Scientist -> Software Engineer?,"I'm currently a data scientist at a big tech company, about 2 years in after a career change in my mid 20s. My current job is about as close to my dream job as it gets. I work on interesting problems and I genuinely enjoy the work. I'm concerned about my career path and am considering switching to software engineer for a few reasons:

1. I only have a bachelor's degree. It's a **solid** bachelors degree (computer science and stats from an ivy), but a bachelor nonetheless. Literally every data science manager i can think of has at least a master's. I'm confident that I *could* make progress at my current company, but at places like google they won't even hire a data scientist without a masters. I'm paying down lots of student debt right now and couldn't dream of going another 100k in the hole. From what I can tell, software engineering doesn't have this hard education cutoff.
2. I write next to no production code. I crank out analyses using jupyter notebooks and SQL like my hair is on fire, but only my final recommendations are seen. Combining this with a recent influx of MBAs into the field, I worry that I'm on track to a not-so-technical career path. Like consultant or something. Not necessarily bad, but I fell in love with writing code before I was a data scientist.
3. The big advances in analytics seem to be coming from building platforms, services, etc. I think I'm naturally inclined to build things and I enjoy this kind of work. Down the road, the combination of these two kinds of data science (business-focus and engineering-focused ) would give me a huge leg up.

Should I make the jump? I'm in my early 30s and I'm just not jazzed about dropping a mortgage down payment for another degree just for the ability to advance. I'd rather leverage what I've learned as a data scientist as a leg up on a career path that doesn't have the same barrier to entry.

I was able redesign lots of processes and helped some other members develop these skills.  
Once I was done with the project I began researching for an internship program.  
On May of 2019, I was very fortunate to start a Industrial Engineering internship on Michelin, one of the most respected tires industries out there. And once again I was recognized for good analytical skills, agility with numbers and was learning stuff really quick.  
However, after a couple months I realized Industrial engineering was more about being able to find physical solutions to processes based on analytical data then analyzing data for the sole purpose of getting new insights. And I've never been interested in tools, machines, manufacturing and such, only data and analysis. Because of that, I dropped off to focus on what interested me more: anything more related to analytics.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** *Just left an internship program in Industrial Engineering because I feel like I should give a shot to analytics, and would like to get to know better about my opportunities to learn and develop skills*.  


After I left the job, I strumbled upon some key words: Big data, Machine learning, Cloud computing, Python, Ansible, Jenkins, and been into a hard time trying to figure it all by myself. Even started a python and data engineer courses.  


I woud like some tips on what to figure out first, some good professionals/ content creators I could follow on social media, and **most importantly**, whats the big picture of it all? How all these pieces fit together? What's the ways from servers' infrastrutcture to data scientists?  


Thank you so much for your time,  
I appreciate it!",lgmorgado,143,114,1494522198.0,1587265998.923008
g2f68k,False,Mathematical Proof That No Decision-making Algorithm Can Be Completely Fair,"I few months ago, when listening to a data science podcast, I came across a notion that there have been papers published demonstrating a mathematical paradox related to algorithmic fairness. The gist was that there a three characteristics that we would ideally like a decision-making algorithm to embody, yet it can be proven mathematically that these can't be simultaneously satisfied—there is always a trade-off. I believe that two of these characteristics were false-positive and false-negative rate but I'm not even sure of that. Is there anyone familiar with this topic that could point me towards the paper?

g2n16d,True,Careers in Decision Science / Decision Analysis?,"**What kinds of jobs can I get after studying decision analysis?**

I was recently admitted to a distance degree programme in ""Decision analysis and Data science"". I'm actually more interested in the decision analysis part of the degree but I'm not sure what kind of jobs I could get after this degree. I'm doing the degree mainly because: 1) the courses seem interesting and 2) it's free.

Here are some of the courses within decision analysis and a short description:

* Decision Support Methods - structuring problems, probability
* Risk Management - probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches to risk management
* Decision Theory
* Programming for Data Science - Python and R
* Analysis of Bases for Decisions - argumentation theory and multi-criteria analysis
* Business Analytics
* Logic
* Methodology of Decision Analysis with Advanced Applications
* Risk and Decision Analysis: Special Problems

I know that this sub is called Data Science but since r/decisionscience is kind of dead and someone made [this post about decision science](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fdl2w5/what_is_decision_science/) here recently, I figured it would be alright to post here.

g2yd94,False,"I am both Data Scientist / Engineer, was this a bad move?","Our departments are split with the CTO running front/back-end and the Chief Data Scientist. I currently work under the CDS. The CTO needs a dedicated Data Engineer and I've maintained and optimised our current databases and ETL pipelines.   


This is a big step up, and A LOT of work. It, however, really solidifies my dependency at the company ( i was worried I would become redundant.)   


I don't think they realise the amount of time-management and prioritising is needed to schedule DS projects and DE projects and to work side-by-side, however, I could just be new to the responsibility.  


Is there anyone who is in the same position, and if so, how difficult is this track? Should I ask for a raise given the double responsibility?

g31ssc,True,What's best to switch to data science?,"At age 31 I've decided to go back to study, and I'm looking for the best recommendation considering my personal situation.

I already have a degree and a masters in Finance. 

Thing is, I get bored. I was working as a credit analyst, but it was boring. About two years ago I learned SQL and started working as a data analyst in the credit department of a company. Then I switched companies and I work with SQL in marketing. 

I've been learning python for a year and I'm able to build scripts and simple machine learning algorithms. The problem is that I don't have much opportunity to apply that at work, and I want to move towards a data scientist role, so that I can apply statistics and predictive modelling. Something that keeps my brain entertained.

So I've considered a few options:

- Getting a degree in computer science
- Getting a degree in statistics
- Getting a masters in data science

What I'd do if I could back in time is to choose statistics. The problem is the I work full-time, and starting a degree now sounds like sacrificing too many years of my life, since I'd have to study part-time and work full-time.

So, my inclination is to go for the masters. I'd have to complete 8 subjects, mainly focused on programming, in order to access it, so I estimate it'd take me 3 years to complete.

If I do that, do you think I could get a job as a data scientist, given my non-stem background? Or at least find a more interesting job in which I can apply predictive modelling and similar?

Or should I better go for a degree in CS or Statistics?",Queenverse_p,53,6,1561148935.0,1587265998.923008

g43rkg,False,Learning Python,"Hi,

I’m wondering how I further my knowledge of data science. As a mechanical engineering major, I don’t have too much experience with coding, but I have gained a proficient level of coding through completing DataCamp courses in R and Python. I have also recently completed some of the machine learning courses on Kaggle, but I find myself not really grasping the material as well as I would like. I have also been working with a high level COVID-19 dataset for practice. I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for how I should proceed with my data science education. Should I take courses on Coursera/Udemy? Should I try participating in Kaggle competitions? Should I continue completing Kaggle/DataCamp courses? Should I apply to data science masters programs? Any other ideas? I would really appreciate any feedback. Thanks!!",CaliforniaRoll97,182,70,1554152808.0,1587265998.923008
